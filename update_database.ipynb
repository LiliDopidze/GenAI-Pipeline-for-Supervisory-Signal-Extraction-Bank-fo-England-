For your information, this conference is being recorded.\\nAt this time, I will hand the call over to your host, Mr. Douglas Flint, Group Chairman.\\nDouglas Flint\\nThank you very much. Good morning from London, good afternoon in Hong Kong, and welcome to the 2016 HSBC annual results call.\\nWith me today are Stuart Gulliver, Group Chief Executive; and Iain MacKay, the Group Finance Director. And before we start, I'd like to say a word on behalf of the board.\\nHSBC's performance in 2016 was broadly satisfactory against the backdrop of far-reaching geopolitical and economic developments. Operating performance in the second half of the year was much stronger than expected as businesses and financial markets responded more optimistically than predicted. The board was happy with the traction from management actions to reshape the group and address the challenges of the continuing low-interest rate environment, and these actions are bearing fruit through market share gains, greater cost efficiency and improved performance. Much of the heavy investments in reshaping the group to improve productivity embrace technological change, and reinforce global standards of business conduct has been made.\\nWe entered 2017 with the restructuring of the group essentially completed and with a strong capital position and a conservative balance sheet.\\nWe delivered in our commitments in maintaining the annual dividend in respect of the year at $0.51 as we indicated at the interim stage, and this was delivered through the declaration today of a fourth interim dividend of $0.21.\\nIn addition to this, the board has determined to return to shareholders up to a further $1 billion, by way of a share buyback.\\nLet me hand over now to Stuart to talk through the key points before Iain takes a more detailed look at our performance. Stuart?\\nStuart Gulliver\\nThanks, Douglas. So turning to Slide 2. We made good progress in 2016. The implementation of our strategic actions is actually well-advanced and our global universal business model performed well in challenging conditions.\\nThe drop in the reported profit before tax reflected a number of significant items. The noncash items included a $3.2 billion write-off of goodwill in Global Private Banking in Europe and fair value losses on our own debt of $1.8 billion.\\nThe cash items included $3.1 billion investment in our cost-reduction programs, $680 million related to legal settlements and provisions and $559 million related to U.K. customer redress. The reported number also includes a $1.7 billion accounting loss on the sale of our Brazil business.\\nOur adjusted profits were broadly unchanged year-on-year, following solid performances by our global businesses. These enabled us to capture market share in strategic product areas and build a platform for future growth. We delivered positive adjusted jaws in 2016.\\nGlobal Banking Markets recovered from a sector-wide slow start to the year to generate higher adjusted revenue than 2015. Commercial Banking performed well, particularly in the U.K. and Hong Kong, growing revenue in spite of a slowdown in global trade.\\nThe Retail Banking and Wealth Management performance was mixed. Overall revenue was down compared to 2015 due largely to the impact of reduced client activity in Hong Kong on our Wealth Management businesses. However, strong mortgage growth and higher currency accounts and savings balances helped to increase revenue in Retail Banking. And we've written off all the remaining goodwill in the European Private Banking business. This goodwill relates principally to the original purchase of Safra Republic Holdings in 1999. The restructuring of Global Private Banking is now largely complete, and although Global Private Banking is now much smaller than it was 3 years ago, it is deliberately positioned for sustainable growth with a focus on serving the personal wealth management needs of the leadership and owners of the group's corporate clients. This was reflected in 2016 through solid revenue growth from group-referred relationships. We also continue to make strong progress on our strategic actions to improve returns and gain maximum value from our international network.\\nMeanwhile, our targeted reduction of risk weighted assets is now 97% complete, and we expect to exceed our reduction target by the end of 2017.\\nOur cost-reduction programs continue to bring down our adjusted operating expenses. The traction that these programs have gained in the last 18 months has enabled us to increase the amount of cost that we're able to remove from the business. We now expect to deliver annualized savings of around $6 billion by the end of 2017, about $1 billion above our original target, and we'll invest in equivalent amounts of around $6 billion over the same time frame to achieve this.\\nImproved lending and deposit balances, interest rate rises and better collaboration between businesses helped generate significantly higher profits in our Mexico business year-on-year and significant market share gains, particularly in consumer lending.\\nWe also continued to build our business in Asia Pacific, launching our first exclusively HSBC-branded credit card in Mainland China, growing assets under management and insurance new business premiums and seeing the first lines of growth in our loan book in the Pearl River Delta. We also extended our leadership with the offshore renminbi bond market to achieve our best ranking for China outbound mergers and acquisitions since 2003.\\nWe also completed the $2.5 billion share buyback in December that we commenced at the half year. We are today announcing a second buyback of up to $1 billion to retire more of the capital that previously supported the Brazil business. Having received the appropriate regulatory clearances, we aim to complete this new buyback in the first half of 2017. This will bring the total value of shares repurchased since last August to USD 3.5 billion.\\nOur strong common equity tier 1 ratio of 13.6% reinforces our ability to invest in the business, support the dividend and consider future share buybacks and manage the continuing uncertain regulatory environment.\\nIain will talk you through the numbers.\\nIain Mackay\\nThanks, Stuart. As you may already know, we have recemented our results with the Global businesses now representing our primary reporting segments and have replaced the business line known as Other with Corporate Center to better reflect the way we manage our business. Corporate Center comprises Central Treasury, including Balance Sheet Management, our legacy businesses, interest in associates and joint ventures, central stewardship costs that support the business and the U.K. bank levy. There are more details on the Corporate Center in the appendix. Our published recementation book would also provide detailed analysis and reconciliation to this reporting change.\\nLooking quickly at some key metrics for 2016, the reported return on average ordinary shareholder's equity was 0.8%. The reported return on average tangible equity was 2.6%. On an adjusted basis, we had positive jaws of 1.2%, and we had tangible net asset value per ordinary share of $6.92. The movement in jaws was due to a 3.7% reduction in adjusted operating expenses, which exceeded the 2.5% fall in adjusted revenue in 2016. Our adjusted measure includes the impact of the bank levy.\\nTangible net asset value fell by $0.45 in the fourth quarter, driven largely by foreign currency exchange differences and movements in available-for-sale investment through other comprehensive income. There's more detail on these movements in the appendix.\\nSlide 4 shows the impact of significant items in currency translation in the fourth quarter on our reported profits and on our return on equity. The largest significant items in Q4 were noncash items, namely the $2.4 billion write-off of the remaining goodwill of the European Global Private Banking business and $1.6 billion arising from changes in credit spreads on our own debt designated at fair value. We also included a $1.1 billion of investment to achieve our cost savings.\\nAdjusted profit before tax for the fourth quarter was up 39% year-on-year. Adjusted profits for the full year were broadly stable. Our return on equity was 0.8% and our return on tangible equity was 2.6% for 2016, both adversely impacted by significant items. Excluding these items and the bank levy, our return on equity was 7.7% and the return on tangible equity was 8.5%.\\nSlide 5 provides more detail on the items that take us from reported to adjusted for both the fourth quarter and the full year. You will find more details of these adjustments in the appendix, and the remainder of the presentation focuses on adjusted numbers.\\nSlide 6 looks at fourth quarter profit before tax. Adjusted profit before tax was $738 million higher than the fourth quarter of 2015 driven by significantly lower loan impairment charges and continued robust cost management. The decrease in revenue is due predominantly to adverse valuation differences on long-term debt and associated swaps caused by sharp interest rate rises in the fourth quarter. The negative impact of these valuation differences was $742 million, compared to a negative impact of $126 million in the same period last year. The full year negative impact of this difference was $278 million.\\nWe did not forecast this for revenue purposes as we hedge these bonds over their duration and the short-term valuation differences are not meaningful. There are more details on this in the appendix. Against this, were our strong performances in Global Banking and Markets and Commercial Banking.\\nSlide 7 looks at revenue. Fourth quarter revenue from our Global businesses was $605 million higher than the last year's fourth quarter. I'll go through each business in more detail in the next few slides.\\nThe $944 million reduction in revenue of Corporate Center between the third and fourth quarters was mainly caused by the valuation difference in long-term debt and associated swaps that I've already described. Reported revenue numbers include a $396 million impact associated with foreign currency translation differences versus the third quarter. On an annual basis, our Global businesses revenue was broadly unchanged.\\nSlide 8 looks at Retail Banking and Wealth Management revenue. Revenue increased by $25 million compared to last year's fourth quarter, increased customer lending and higher deposits throughout 2016 helped grow fourth quarter Retail Banking revenue by $66 million. Wealth Management revenue also grew by $40 million, driven by investment distribution in Asia. Lending growth accelerated in the fourth quarter, particularly in mortgages in Hong Kong and the U.K. For the full year, adjusted revenue was down 2% as 1% growth in Retail Banking revenue was more than offset by a fall in Wealth Management. This was principally caused by the impact of our investment business that reduced client activity in Hong Kong, particularly in the first half of the year.\\nAs Slide 9 shows, Commercial Banking revenue was broadly stable compared to last year's fourth quarter. We continue to see strong balance sheet growth in the fourth quarter with $6 billion of additional lending and a further $11 billion of deposits. This contributed to a 5% revenue increase in Global Liquidity and Cash Management compared to last year's fourth quarter.\\nTLAC costs and the impact of market movements in Asia on insurance revenue caused revenue in Other to fall by 16%. For the full year, Commercial Banking revenue grew $534 million or 1%. This included growth in Global Liquidity and Cash Management of $181 million, driven by increased balances and wider spreads in Hong Kong. Credit and lending also increased by $83 million, reflecting continued loan growth in the U.K. These were partly offset by lower revenue in Global Trade and Receivables Finance.\\nGlobal Banking and Markets had a strong fourth quarter, increasing revenue by 23% year-on-year. Foreign exchange, rates, banking and global liquidity and cash management all grew revenue, capitalizing an increased client flows and market movements.\\nFor the full year, Global Banking and Markets revenue rose by $353 million or 2% compared to 2015. This included a net negative impact of $297 million related to adverse movements in credits and funding valuation adjustments.\\nExcluding these movements, revenue rose by $650 million or 5%, mainly in rates and credit, as we paid market share in Europe. Revenue also increased in Global Liquidity and Cash Management as we grew average balances and benefited from wider spreads. This was a good performance from Global Banking and Markets in 2016. Since 2014, adjusted risk-weighted assets in Global Banking and Markets have fallen by 14%, and adjusted revenue have risen by 10%. This demonstrated the effectiveness of both our risk-weighted asset reduction program and our targeted investment in the business.\\nSlide 11 looks at Global Private Banking, which saw a fall in revenue of $43 million or 10% compared to last year's fourth quarter. This largely reflected the continued repositioning of the business and reduced market activity.\\nDuring 2016, we disposed our private banking businesses in Bermuda and Brazil and a client portfolio in Europe. These disposals are reflected in the fall in client assets during the period. The repositioning of Global Private Banking is now substantially complete.\\nFor the full year, adjusted revenue fell by $208 million or 11%. We attracted more than $5 billion of net new money from collaborations by global business customers in 2016. Corporate Center revenue fell by $944 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. This was principally due to a net $616 million reduction from adverse valuation differences on long-term debt and associated swaps, and the loss of revenue from the run-off of our U.S. CML portfolio. Balance Sheet Management revenue rose by $133 million or 21% against last year's fourth quarter. Balance Sheet Management for the full year was up by $175 million or 7%. We reduced the remaining U.S. run-off portfolio by 49%, which contributed $8 billion of the $22 billion RWA reduction in the fourth quarter. We expect to complete the disposal of the CML assets during 2017.\\nFull year net interest margin of 173 -- 1.73%, sorry, was 15 basis points lower than 2015. 8 of those basis points came from the disposal of our operations in Brazil and currency translation differences, particularly in the U.K. and Mexico. The remainder came largely from lower yields in customer lending, including revenue lost from the run-off of our U.S. CML portfolio and an increase in the cost of debt, including around $400 million of TLAC interest costs.\\nSlide 14 looks at operating expenses. Our operating expenses, excluding the bank levy, increased by 5% from the prior fiscal quarter, reflecting a small number of specific items, and these included a write-off of around $150 million relating to software that we no longer use and a spending increase related to marketing programs launched in the fourth quarter.\\nOur cost performance in 2016 was excellent with a $1.2 billion or 4% drop in adjusted operating expenses. We removed $2.2 billion of costs from the business in 2016, bringing a total annualized run rate savings since we started our cost savings program to around $3.7 billion.\\nOur U.K. bank levy charge was $499 million lower than 2015, including a positive adjustment of $128 million relating to previous year. These reductions were partially offset by the impact of inflation and further investment in regulatory programs and compliance.\\nOur total expenditure in regulatory programs and compliance was $3 billion, which was around $4 million or 14% higher than in 2015. We expect an increase of more than 10% in regulatory and compliance costs in 2017.\\nSlide 15 walks you from 2014 operating expenses to a revised 2017 exit run rate target. While we are investing more in regulatory and compliance programs, we're also continuing to invest in growth and improvements in the business. We will more than pay for this investment through additional cost savings, which will require additional one-off investments to remove these costs from the business. We've already invested around 90% of the amount that we originally said we would by the end of 2017 to achieve our target cost savings and improve the operating capabilities and productivity of the group.\\nWe now expect to invest a total of around $6 billion by the end of 2017 to achieve total run rate cost savings of around $6 billion, around $1 billion above the top end of our Investor Day target range.\\nSlide 16 looks at loan impairment charges. Fourth quarter LICs were down $83 million from the third quarter of 2016, down $825 million compared to fourth quarter of 2015. Fourth quarter LICs for 2016 had no outstanding features, and the credit outlook remains benign. There is no small -- there is no small part due to the strength of our risk management and portfolio repositioning since 2011.\\nIn 2016, as a whole, loan impairment charges were $48 million higher than 2015 due to a small number of individually assessed LICs in Global Banking and Markets, raising oil and gas and mining sectors in the U.S. in the first half of the year. There were also higher charges in Retail Banking and Wealth Management, particularly in Mexico as we grew our market share of retail and consumer banking products. These entries were mostly offset by a large reduction in Commercial Banking charges.\\nSlide 17 breaks down adjusted profit for 2016 by global business and geography. The overall story is unchanged since the third quarter. Adjusted profit before tax was down by $228 million or 1% due to lower revenue and marginally higher loan impairment charges, but this was largely offset by good progress in costs. The effectiveness of our cost-reduction program means that we achieved positive jaws of 1.2% in 2016 in spite of a tough revenue environment.\\nWe generated a further $38 billion of risk-weighted asset reductions in the fourth quarter, bringing total reductions for the year to $142 billion. $17 billion of the fourth quarter total came from Global Banking and Markets and legacy credit. $8 billion came from our U.S. CML one-off portfolios, $5 billion from Commercial Banking and $8 billion from other, mainly in Balance Sheet Management. The total reduction since the start of 2015 now stands at $267 billion, around 44% of which came from Global Banking and Markets and legacy credit. This takes us more than 97% of the way towards our target, which we expect to exceed through continued focus on efficient capital deployment.\\nTurning to capital, the group's common equity tier 1 ratio was 13.6% in 31 December, compared with 13.9% at the end of the third quarter. Common equity tier 1 capital reduced by $9 billion in the fourth quarter, due mainly to foreign exchange movements, dividends and reported loss for the period. Impact of this reduction in our common equity tier 1 ratio was mitigated by the reduction in risk-weighted assets. Today's buyback announcement reduces common equity tier 1 ratio to 13.5%.\\nSlide 20 looks to the year ahead. Our financial targets maintain our focus on improving returns, delivering cost productivity consistently and providing sustainable returns to shareholders. Our medium-term revenue prospects remain good, supported by loan growth and strong deposit growth in 2016 and steeper yield curves and rising interest rates in the U.S. and Hong Kong.\\nOur restructured business is increasingly well-positioned to capture further opportunities, and our Global businesses [indiscernible] momentum from the fourth quarter into the start of 2017. We have traction in our cost management and productivity improvement programs with persistent focus in improving returns supported by continued commitment to capital efficiency.\\nUncertainty in the geopolitical and regulatory environments were main considerations. There are also a number of near-term revenue headwind that are worth bearing in mind. Restating 2016 reported revenues based on average January 2017 foreign exchange rates would reduce them by $2 billion. Clearly, costs benefited from such FX movements.\\nWe expect around $500 million of additional TLAC interest costs in 2017 and a potential $300 million revenue impact from lower U.K. interest rates.\\nIt's also worth remembering that while the run-off of our U.S. CML legacy portfolio is clearly good news, we will lose the revenue associated with the assets that we sell as well as the associated impairment losses.\\nI'll now hand back to Stuart.\\nStuart Gulliver\\nThanks, Iain. So Slide 21 shows our progress [indiscernible] actions we outlined at our investor update in June 2015. We're now 18 months into a 2.5-year program, and a large majority of actions remain on track. We're going to beat our original targets to reduce both risk-weighted assets and costs, as Iain has already said.\\nMexico also continues to recover strongly, adjusted PBT more than tripled in 2016 and revenue grow 18% year-on-year. We grew lending by 14%, increasing our market share of personal loans, payroll loans and mortgages and raising our advances to deposit ratio. We also grew Global Trade, Receivables Finance and Global Liquidity and Cash Management revenues in Mexico by 11% and 19%, respectively.\\nThe low-interest rate environment, however, continued to keep the U.S. business off-track, although adjusted revenues in Global Banking and Markets and Retail Banking and Wealth Management both grew in 2016. The network benefits of the U.S. business have also increased as we grew revenue from the international subsidiaries of our U.S. clients by 11% compared with 2015.\\nThe establishment of the U.K. ring-fenced bank remains on track. Both the chair and CEO positions of HSBC U.K. have now been filled, following the announcements of Clara Furse as Chair and Ian Stuart as Chief Executive.\\nThe migration of roles from London to Birmingham is around 35% complete, with the remainder on track to be in place by the time the bank launches in 2018. Our international network continued to drive revenue growth in our transaction banking product lines. Level of liquidity in Cash Management revenue increased by 6% year-on-year, and Global Trade and Receivables Finance captured further market share in strategic markets, including Hong Kong and Singapore.\\nIn 2016, we were named Best Bank for Corporates by Euromoney and Best Supply Chain Finance Bank at the Trade Finance Awards.\\nWe continue to invest for growth in Asia. We launched a new digital banking platform for SMEs in Guangdong, a growing business around the China-led Belt and Road initiative, and we were named Asia's Best Investment Bank and Asia's Best Bank for Financing by Euromoney. Assets under management in Asia increased by 11%, and we grew revenue from the international subsidiaries of our ASEAN region commercial banking clients.\\nWe continue to be the leading bank for international renminbi products and services, and we're better protected from financial crime because of our investments in our Global Standards program. Our Monitor has raised certain concerns, but we will continue to progress and our commitment remains unwavering.\\nBy the end of this year, we're on track to have our AML and sanctions policy framework in place and to have introduced major compliance IT systems across the group. Beyond 2017, we will continue to work to fine-tune those systems and ensure that our improvements are fully integrated into our day-to-day risk management practices.\\nSo to conclude, I'd like to leave you with 4 points. First, our strategy is working. Our global businesses are performing well in challenging operating conditions. Our international network, our main differentiator, is delivering more than 45% of client revenue. We're capturing market share in strategic areas. We have an unrivaled business in Asia with strong returns and good momentum. And we've delivered positive adjusted jaws in 2016, and we expect to do this again in 2017.\\nSecond, we're doing what we've said we'd do. We're going to exceed both our original risk-weighted asset and cost reduction targets. We sold our Brazil business, which allowed us to complete the first share buyback in our history and to announce today a second buyback of $1 billion. Our Mexico business is being turned around quickly and effectively, and our investment in Asia is delivering more revenue for the group in strategic areas.\\nThird, more than ever, there's a big advantage in being a diversified global bank. The complexity of the current environment and the potential difficulty in connecting customers with strong growth opportunities, naturally benefits the bank with our network and heritage. The world is evolving into big regional trading blocks with less global trade, with vastly increased regional trade in the areas where barriers are falling fastest are the regions where HSBC is strongest. Our long-standing and growing, strength in infrastructure and project financing in Asia and Europe also positioned us perfectly to capitalize on opportunities arriving from the China-led Belt and Road initiative and the rising prominence of green finance.\\nFinally, we remain a well-funded business with strong capital generation, a diversified balance sheet and an excellent record of delivering value for shareholders. Last year, we delivered a total shareholder return of 36% in Hong Kong dollars, while building a common equity tier 1 ratio of 13.6%. We've maintained the dividend in 2016 and we're confident doing so for the foreseeable future.\\nWe're now happy to take questions. The operator will explain the procedure, and introduce the first question. Operator?\\nOperator\\n[Operator Instructions] We will now take our first question from Ronit Ghose from Citigroup.\\nRonit Ghose\\nCan I just pick up on a couple of points relating to revenues? Q4 seems to be a bit of disappointment, vis-a-vis market expectation, maybe just better forecasting. But you're highlighting lots of 2017 challenges, while talking up the medium term. And if you can just dig into this please, on specifically the growth outlook, you say you're very well-positioned -- you're well-positioned for growth in Asia. Loan growth is running at about 4% right now in Asia for you. Do you expect that run rate to accelerate from 4%? In your statements, you've mentioned some of the leading indicators, macro indicators are picking up, trade is picking up. Yet it's pretty uncertain in terms of outlook. So I'm just wondering if that kind of 4% revenue sort of loan growth -- 4% loan growth can be stronger in your Asian footprint this year. Linked to that on the revenues, the margins -- is most of the margin, the underlying margin weakness that you've seen in Q4, down to loan spreads coming down? And how much more sort of pressure do you expect on the spread in the U.K. and the U.S., particularly in the U.K? And finally, on the one-offs, the -- there's a $1 billion swing in treasury that Iain obviously called out. And I'm just curious as to why you're not putting that into the one-offs. And can you say that you expect this to kind of net to 0 over time? How should we try to think about that treasury revenue number?\\nIain Mackay\\nThere's a loss in here. I think from -- I mean, Stuart can provide some context on this. We clearly don't include based on loan growth coming through our Global Banking and Markets, and we saw encouragement coming through retail bank as well in the fourth quarter of last year with some momentum coming into 2017. But I think the growth rates that you referred to, Ronit, around 4% to 5%, are probably in line with what we are presently seeing and what we would expect to see through 2017 in that particular area. Moving on to margins, there are a couple of factors coming through in the fourth quarter. You will notice, and we commented here, that again you got accelerated reductions in our U.S. CML run-off portfolio in the fourth quarter and notwithstanding that, that historically has been a loss-making portfolio. It is a very strong NIM portfolio, and as we continue to sell and run-off those assets, that feeds through to NIM. The other factor that we saw in the fourth quarter was the impact really of the MIL [ph] or TLAC, depending on what you want to call it, coming through in the fourth quarter, having issued last year over $31 billion worth of instruments into the marketplace to meet those regulatory requirements. And another factor that was an influence in the fourth quarter was the impact of the bank rate reduction earlier in the year. That was certainly reflected in the fourth quarter. And I think those are probably 2 of the main features that come through in that regard. FX, again, quite a [indiscernible].\\nStuart Gulliver\\nImpact coming from the weakness in Mexican peso and Chinese renminbi, the Egyptian pound and, of course, the U.K. pound, which also, if you translate them into U.S. dollars, has a sort of negative impact. And loans and advances actually grew quite strongly in the fourth quarter, which is to say is why we can see some revenue growth, but not above that 4%, 5% handle. The specific thing that caused a lot of the miss against honest estimates in the revenue line is specifically around debt issued, and Iain you should just talk about that a little bit as to, as you say, why it's not in significant items.\\nIain Mackay\\nYes, if you look at the total year impact, we have a number of long-dated bonds outstanding, part of the overall funding structure for the group. And those are matched by interest rate swaps. So those are fixed-rate instruments, hedged, swapped into floating because majority of our book is floating-rate and they are matched economically across the duration. What we clearly saw, some of the longer-dated bonds, as what we saw in the fourth quarter, is we saw a little bit of winding in the valuation curve. So the bond is valued off a LIBOR curve and the swap by convention is valued off the overnight Index swap rate. And there's a little bit of divergence that came through in that regard, which impacted more in the fourth quarter than have been over the course of the year. If you look to the total year, the impact was less -- it was about $200 million, $270 million for the full year impact. We haven't historically seen a great deal of volatility coming through this, and we don't really do anything particular from a forecasting perspective for the reasons that I described, is that if you hold these bonds and the economic hedge swap against them due to maturity, the impact should broadly migrate towards 0. This has really been a relatively insignificant feature within the P&L and within the revenue line over recent quarters, and it was really part of that yield -- the current yield that we saw in the second half year that largely influenced it. Whether we reclassify this going forward, I think, will largely depend on the volatility that we see coming through this. But to be clear, we'll provide insight to it when we do see it coming through every quarter.\\nRonit Ghose\\nCan I just have a quick supplementary on the RBWM revenues? You called out as well you mentioned there's a weakness in Wealth. Is that client activity or is that sort of the traditional life insurance type returns, it's like an investment return weakness in the first quarter? Is that client volumes slowing in the fourth quarter?\\nStuart Gulliver\\nNo, it's actually the first half. And actually, it was an incredibly strong first half of 2015, it's Hong Kong Shanghai stock connect, and then remember that first quarter 2016 was a really slow start and quite difficult for everything related to capital markets, generally. That created weakness in the first quarter first half in Wealth Management, particularly in Hong Kong, and the second half never made it back up.\\nRonit Ghose\\nBut it looks like -- maybe I misread it, but it looks like Q3 was really strong and Q4 was a bit weaker, a couple of hundred million weaker quarter-on-quarter in Hong Kong Wealth or in [indiscernible] Wealth.\\nStuart Gulliver\\nNo, I think what we saw coming through was fairly good numbers from a Retail Banking perspective rather than the wealth piece. So Hong Kong there's big growth in deposits [indiscernible] deposits in the Retail Banking space.\\nIain Mackay\\nYes, and I think what we also see seasonally within the Asian business, with Hong Kong in particular, is a little bit of repositioning around the end of the year. So from an investment distribution perspective, the revenue was down slightly in the fourth quarter versus the third, but nothing of particular note.\\nOperator\\nOur next question today comes from Alastair Ryan from Bank of America.\\nAlastair Ryan\\n[indiscernible] So the net interest margin, just coming back to that, is 1.75% in the first half, 1.73% for the full year. How should we think about sort of the exit run rate and how quickly the December dollar rate hike starts to outweigh the earlier in 2016 rate cuts in place around the U.K? Second, Iain, just on your comments on the CML. Now you're quite clear you hope to be out of that in 2017. Did I understand correctly that the entities will be gone as well then, because, clearly, in the past, they have been a big consumer of stress test capital for you? And thirdly, just on your comment on Slide 20, an encouraging start to the year. Can I encourage you to quantify encouraging?\\nIain Mackay\\nOkay, so I'll start. On NIM, just going back, taking the fourth quarter discrete where NIM in the fourth quarter was 160 basis points. Now if you take out the annualized effect of Brazil, on a year-to-date basis during the third quarter, you take out the annualized effect of Brazil, that's 10 basis points. You then have about a 5 or 6 basis point move between the third quarter and the fourth quarter. That's contributed to buyout a little bit of asset compression coming through U.K. mortgages. So what we clearly saw last year was a pretty competitive environment for U.K. mortgages. We competed in that market more broadly with strengthening our presence in the broker channel, as we've talked about over the course of the year. So we saw a little bit of spread compression coming through there. At the end of the year and beginning of this year, you probably noticed there was coverage by the fact that some of the better-priced products in that space had been withdrawn just as we responded to some of the pressures in that area. Other factors coming through I've already mentioned, one of it was the CML portfolio, and TLAC costs. But the discrete fourth quarter was 160 basis points, Alistair. In terms of CCAR and CML, we'll have substantially all of the assets. And by that, I mean we expect being well under $1 billion of remaining unpaid principal balances, probably around $300 million to $400 million of unpaid principal balances outstanding by the time we get to the half year. Now when you reflect on that from a CCAR and a DFAST stress-testing perspective in the U.S. it's the asset portfolio that's caused the stress. It's not per se -- it's not the existence of the legal entity. So what we would expect to have accomplished by the half year is substantially all the assets be gone and the process of winding down the legal entity has in actual fact already commenced. That is a state-by-state regulated business in the U.S. and as we come out of a state with no further loans understanding, we start rationalizing those legal entities. And clearly, for a number of years now, have been rationalizing the infrastructure supporting that business. But the cause of stress coming through CCAR and DFAST was the asset portfolio. So as that goes, the opportunity to be stressed in that regard will go with it. And in terms of encouraging, I mean, I think on Chart 20, as you see, we've laid out some of the short-term pressures that we see. Clearly, foreign exchange had an adverse impact on revenues last year. Those are [indiscernible] particularly moving in an encouraging direction in an early part of the year. We will continue with a 30 -- just over $31 billion of MREL instruments out in the market last year. Consistent with previous guidance, we've got somewhere between 60 to 80 to do, so the 2017 should be a reasonably big year in that regard once again and there will be some costs associated with that. Lower U.K. interest rate, that's just really the full year impact of what we saw happen in the bank rate area in 2016, and then there's a CML. But we do see those as largely being short-term influences. But what we have seen and we talked about it earlier is the growth coming through the Asian business and notwithstanding some of the geopolitical uncertainty in the U.K. That business performed well in Commercial Banking, Global Banking and Markets over the course of 2016 as well, and hopefully carrying some momentum into 2017. So I think in the run, we're reasonably optimistic, but we do have some short-term revenue headwinds to deal with.\\nStuart Gulliver\\nJust Alistair, the rate rise in December probably adds about $300 million to the NI of 2017 and about $500 million to $600 million in subsequent years. We've assumed 2 rate rises in this year, but in the second half of the year. So if we have a rate rise in March, that will be obviously be an earlier benefit for us. January was a strong month. GBM had a strong January, but obviously, that type of business you can't really extrapolate, but it had a strong January and so did RBWM as the impact of higher rates came through the deposit base, which is essentially the number I've just mentioned.\\nOperator\\nNext question today comes from Chira Barua from Bernstein.\\nChirantan Barua\\nThree quick ones. One, Iain, you mentioned about the CML portfolio and the wind down. We've always been interested in the excess capital there. You've announced $1 billion buyback right now from your Brazilian proceeds. How should we think about now the excess capital, when do you hear from the Fed next and when will you communicate with The Street with regards to what you do with capital repatriation from the U.S.? That's number one. Second, the reg and compliance cost just keeps going up and up. I mean, it's a significant item, and I know that you've brought in a new cost plan. It will be great to understand how do you see the $3 billion, $3.5 billion going forward over the next 3, 4 years, what is the key and what is not? And the third, a quick technical question. Your rate sensitivity on Rest of Asia has gone up sharply from the first half. Is there a liquidity book that you have moved to China and Singapore, somewhere else? Just want to understand what's driving that uptick in sensitivity.\\nIain Mackay\\nOkay, from a CML perspective or more broadly U.S. capital, we had within our CCAR submission for 2016 a dividend proposal from the U.S. holding company to the parent in early 2017. So actually, at the beginning of the second quarter in 2017. That capital plan raised no objection from the Federal Reserve, so we would expect that dividend to proceed in the early second quarter of this year. When that does proceed, we'll let you know, obviously, what the number is. Broadly speaking, we've described having in excess of $8 billion of surplus capital in the U.S., and that's been informed by the portfolio repositioning over the course of the last few years, the disposition of the credit card business back in 2012, '13, the run-off of the CML portfolio, the overall reshaping of the business. I think we've also guided that the expectation in terms of being able to move the surplus capital out of the U.S. also clearly continuing to invest appropriately in the growth of our U.S. business is something that's likely to take 3 to 5 years and certainly one of the things that informs that, in fact, the key thing that informs that, is us continuing to be successful in our CCAR submissions, our next one will be in the 1st of April of this year, and ensuring that we continue to improve our overall capacity to plan, forecast and manage the capital position within our U.S. business. But I think we certainly remain very confident in terms of being able to get the capital position in the U.S. to an appropriate standing with respect to the risks and the business that we run in the U.S., and thereby repatriating capital to the parent company. But we'll keep you posted.\\nStuart Gulliver\\nSo on regulatory programs and compliance, so as you noted, it's -- the total expenditure was about $3 billion. In 2016, it's about $400 million higher than in 2015. Of this, the spend on Global Standards was about $1.6 billion in 2016 within that $3 billion number. And probably, the expenditure on Global Standards peaks in 2017, we expect the implementation of systems and IT platform to oversee that therefore enable us to scale without incremental costs going up with that scaling. However, this is part of our BAU, so I would not expect us to see a material reduction either in that $3 billion number. But as I say, 2017 should be the peak number, but then I would expect us to see that repeat in 20 years.\\nIain Mackay\\nI think going back just momentarily to your capital question, Chira. How do we deal with that? I mean, the capital that comes back to the parent company in the form of dividends, capital transactions like the Brazilian disposal, any dividends that we've received from the U.S. legal entity or any other presumes the general capital pool of the parent company. And the deployment of that is focused on investing to grow the business, supporting the dividend for shareholders. And as we've said, from time to time, as appropriate, we'll consider buybacks. I wouldn't necessarily link any of the capital actions specifically to buybacks or anything else. It becomes part of the general pool, which Stuart and the management team, along with the board, then make decisions around how that is attributed to the various priorities.\\nStuart Gulliver\\nSo the Asia Pacific rate sensitivity, pretty big growth in deposits in China. Remember, China sits in our Asia Pacific number. Big rate move down in China on that deposit base, so much more rate sensitive. There's no book being moved.\\nOperator\\nNext question today comes from the line of Raul Sinha from JPMorgan.\\nRaul Sinha\\nIf I can have 2 please. Just the first one on the rate sensitivity again. I think you've been very clear on the short end of the curve and the sensitivity to that. But you also mentioned steepening of the U.S. and the Hong Kong yield curves. And so I was wondering if you could maybe talk a little bit about the sensitivity to the mid or the long end of the curve and how you might be positioned or changing your positioning on that, especially in Q4.\\nIain Mackay\\nAgain, not much really when you think about what were the U.S. dollar rate really benefited in the second half last year, it was at the long end, it was 10 years and beyond. When you look at the asset composition of our balance sheet, we don't have a particularly large component of the balance sheet. In fact, the relatively small proportion of the balance sheet is longer dated, with the majority really sitting below 5 years. So clearly, steepening of the curve helps us. It's going to take longer to work its way through the asset base and real results in terms of uptick. So what helps us are policy rate increases and movements in the shorter end of the curve. And so it's a help, but it does not have the same impact as things at the shorter end.\\nThe way to think about that enhancement is it's a 3-year number.\\nRaul Sinha\\nOkay, that's helpful.\\nStuart Gulliver\\nIt's kind of 1 month, 3 years is steep, we can't have a lot money riding down that curve. But think about a 3 years number. So what the 10-year or 30-year does is not that relevant.\\nIain Mackay\\nAnd I think, broadly speaking, if you think about it in these terms, we talked about this before. A rising rate environment you're generally going to see that improvement coming through in the businesses, Retail Bank, Wealth Management, Commercial Bank, Global Banks and Markets, with a possible downside to that within Balance Sheet Management. But by the same token, you will have seen highly consistent earnings coming through Balance Sheet Management over the course of the last 4 or 5 years where it is consistently falling within the $2.5 billion to $3 billion this year being at the peak end of that range.\\nRaul Sinha\\nOkay. And just the second one, we haven't talked about asset quality yet on the call. But obviously, it's very a good quarter. I think you had some write-backs in Q4 as well. But clearly, some of your peers have had different experiences more recently. And obviously, you've got quite a low risk profile in the balance sheet. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about what's the real underlying run rate you see in terms of provisions and what your thoughts are in terms of the outlook. Can it get better from this or is this as good as it gets?\\nIain Mackay\\nLook, I think one of the things -- certainly, as a couple of the Asian banks came out with their results last week, we had a quick call with our colleagues in Hong Kong over the weekend just to get any really up-to-date feedback about what we saw coming through. And the story has been remarkably consistent in terms of asset quality across Retail Bank, Commercial Banking, Global Banking and Markets. The year was clearly impacted by higher provisions on metals and mining and oil and gas sector, principally in our North American businesses. But that being said, we saw some credits coming through in Commercial Banking business in those sectors as the year progressed. But credit quality, whether you look at it from a China perspective, Hong Kong, the wider Asian, the U.K., the European, it remains very, very stable. And there are no really adverse indicators at this point coming through the book. Questions have been put to us earlier this morning by Reuters, Bloomberg, for example, is have we seen any impact from Brexit. And at this point in the game, no, we absolutely haven't. So I think overall credit quality remains stable. We did get some credits coming through in the fourth quarter, which gives us probably a slightly artificial view. But again, we're in a fairly benign point in the cycle. I am, as you know, notoriously disinclined to forecast LICs from a basis point as a percentage of outstanding loans. But again, if you sort of take kind of where you saw oil and gas, metals and mining, exposure has been dealt with by us in the course of the late 2015 and '16. And normalized for that, you get some sense as to where the run rate might be.\\nRaul Sinha\\nSure. But Iain, any thoughts on IFRS 9 and how that might change in terms of should we start to think about that from 2018 in terms of your provision?\\nIain Mackay\\nWell, the industry is certainly thinking about it big time, I think more probably in terms of the context of how it affects capital and volatility within the capital ratio. Thinking about this over the duration of our loan, it shouldn't change. If we maintain consistent underwriting and discipline in terms of how we manage the book, it should not change the lifetime loss experience. However, the timing with which that gets recognized from a Stage 1, Stage 2, Stage 3 perspective, and IFRS 9 clearly could or almost certainly will introduce some volatility. And if you were to see significant sectoral downturns, again, I'll refer back to the stuff we saw in oil and gas at the end of 2015, that would move quite a lot of the book into Stage 2, and you'd see some significant upward volatility, upward movement and one with impairment charges. But from a lifetime credit cost perspective, it shouldn't change, unless we allow that short-term volatility to further feed [ph] to how we actually underwrite and manage the exposure. And I think that's something we could focus on. If you step back from the standard itself, I think the area where our regulators are beginning, but only just beginning to think about, is how that leads through to a potential short-term volatility in capital ratios and how they deal with that. So look, the industry is full-steam ahead in implementing the standard, and it goes in the 1st of January next year. You will see volatility. In the FDI, what you'll see is credit losses are recognized much, much earlier in the cycle. Whether that necessarily is a good thing remains to be seen, but lifetime impacts should remain reasonably consistent.\\nRaul Sinha\\nOkay. And when -- just quickly, when do you think we might get some guidance in terms of the impact or the upfront impact of IFRS 9?\\nIain Mackay\\nSecond half.\\nOperator\\nNext question today comes from Claire Kane from Cr\\u00e9dit Suisse.\\nClaire Kane\\nA couple of follow-up questions on the revenue outlook, please. Firstly, on the NIM, I think you said 160 basis points for Q4. Did you say that the like-for-like sequential impact was minus 5 bps, so Q3 was 165? And also, could you explain if there was any hedging impact in there or was that 5 bps broadly related to just the U.K.? And then my second point is on the MREL or TLAC guidance. You said it would go up to $0.9 billion for 2017. Can you confirm that, that is our long-term run rate? Or should we expect that's been additional impact going into '18 and beyond if you need to be MREL-compliant by 2021? And then finally, my third question, just really to wrap it up. Clearly, from the headwinds you flagged in terms of FX broadly relates to the first half of '16. So if we consider the second half adjusted revenue run rate of around just under $49 billion, consensus is looking for around 6% uplift year-on-year versus that run rate. Given your commentary around volumes, do you think that's reasonable in the context of the NIM pressures?\\nStuart Gulliver\\nIain, go ahead.\\nIain Mackay\\nSo to be clear, the 5 bps, you're right, the 5 bps impact, it was influenced by the factors I mentioned earlier in the call with U.K. -- compression in U.K. mortgages was one of the contributors. That was about 2 or 3 basis points. TLAC and CML one-off were the other contributors. There was no real notable impact from hedging coming through in the fourth quarter. It was informed by assets on the balance sheet and movements within that. From an MREL perspective, the long-term guidance that we provided is consistent, $60 billion to $80 billion based on firming up guidance coming from our regulators as to exactly how much is required, where it is required to be positioned, the characteristics of it. Clearly, there is a first threshold, which is compliant by 2019, and that's really what we've focused on. So within that time frame, somewhere between USD 60 billion to USD 80 billion of issuance to be accomplished; $31 billion accomplished in 2016. Broadly speaking, assuming there's good reception for this in the marketplace, we'd expect it to be much the same in 2017. And to the extent that any further issuance is required, we'll complete that in 2018, then reach the first threshold of compliance in 2019. Clearly, as you point out, the final compliance time line around the full implementation of MRELs is 2022. So I think based on the guidance we are today, the $900 million is broadly consistent, subject to whether or not there is more that needs to be done in 2018. And I think we really need greater clarity in guidance around quantification and characterization and frequency of MREL from our regulators, not only in Europe, but further afield because there's -- it's not called MREL outside Europe, it's called TLAC. But it is a global phenomenon that needs to be implemented. But I wouldn't change the long-term guidance in that regard at this point. In terms of overall revenue outlook for 2017, I'm not really super keen on filling out the old spreadsheet for you there. So we've given you some pretty good guidance around what we think the FX impact is, with our other short-term pressures that we've highlighted, but we've also talked to the kind of growth that we see coming through the business. And what we've seen certainly in the fourth quarter and the first few weeks of 2017 has been encouraging in that regard.\\nClaire Kane\\nOkay. Could I maybe just have one follow-up then? In terms of the NII trajectory versus the Q4 run rate, do you think volumes would more than mitigate the NIM pressure that you've guided to relative to the Q4 base?\\nIain Mackay\\nWe will certainly be focused on the management of the assets that we underwrite. Our teams in BSM do a great job of managing the overall liquidity portfolio and interest rate risk, and they're booked for us. So our focus will be in trying to mitigate NIM pressures and continue to grow volumes to offset that, but also to grow volumes in a way that accrete returns for the business. That's a discipline which Samir and his colleagues, Noah and his colleagues, John and his colleagues are very focused on is putting business on the books that bring us to improved returns against risk-weighted assets and returns on equity in the business. And I think when you look at the return in risk-weighted assets and the improvements that Global Banking and Markets have realized, Commercial Banking have realized, that is encouraging, and that's a discipline that's going to remain in place.\\nOperator\\nNext question today comes from Tom Rayner from Exane.\\nThomas Rayner\\nJust a couple of questions, please. If we can actually just go back to the share buyback announcement because you're fairly clear that this is a first half buyback and it's very much linked still to the capital release from Brazil. So my question is once we get to, say, the interim stage that the CCAR is behind you and assuming there's no problems with any of that, is it fair to assume that then it's like a clean page for the rest of the year, we shouldn't take this $1 billion necessarily as a proxy for what you're planning to do for the year as a whole? That's my first question. And then I've got another question on the revenue headwinds, if that's okay.\\nStuart Gulliver\\nSo yes, Tom, what you should assume is that as we have evidence last year, we're starting to obviously manage our capital in a much more active way than we've been able to do previously because at 13.6%, 13.5% after this buyback, we are in a good position. And what we'll be doing is looking at what our capital position is. First of all, trying to actually not have this as surplus capital, but actually use it in the business by obviously putting on risk-weighted assets as accretive returns. If we can't put them out as accretive returns and assuming that we're nicely covered on the dividend, it's possible, subject to regulatory approval, we might look at doing further buybacks. So the first priority has got to be to see if we can actually make this work within the business, and that will be the huge focus of all of the teams. The focus of the teams is not essentially to see if we can buy back; the focus of the teams is to see if we can get accretive RWAs to close within the business. So yes, I think the way you'd characterize it is that you get to the interims with a blank sheet of paper is the way to think about it. But I don't think you should raise expectations and start modeling perpetual buybacks; we won't be doing that. If we actually do see reasonable growth coming around, if we see higher interest rates, as I've said earlier, Balance Sheet Management, the whole series of books make a lot of money and we have a north to $3 billion [ph] area, we got steeper curves, we'll actually be using that capital up in the business.\\nThomas Rayner\\nOkay. Okay, very clear. Just on the revenue headwind, just a little bit more color. You mentioned TLAC, I think, Iain, you've said the sort of $900 million for now is the guidance. I'm assuming that is -- the $900 million is a net figure, that's not a sort of cost of the new TLAC, which will be offset by some uneligible debt maturing. Is that right, what I'm thinking about?\\nIain Mackay\\nThat side is the negative carry we've talked about, Tom. Clearly, the focus within the business is to find ways of deploying that higher cost debt in a way that we can mitigate our negative carry to the extent possible. So again, that's a focus in which Balance Sheet Management is zeroed in. And clearly, we bring the expertise to bear from clearly Stuart's experience as well as Samir and the teams in terms of how we mitigate that. But that is a negative carry that we're projecting.\\nThomas Rayner\\nSure. And then just on the FX. You flagged up the $2 billion headwind if rates stay at the January level. But obviously, as it works through the P&L, it's going to affect the other lines as well. How should that drop down to sort of pretax or even net income in terms of headwind? Would it be the same sort of percentage impact all the way down the income statement?\\nIain Mackay\\nSo Tom, we would certainly expect to see some kind of corresponding benefit coming through the operating expenses, which mitigates some of that headwind that we see coming through revenues from FX. So I think if you sort of think of it in broad terms, perhaps about 30% that we see having an adverse impact on the P&L because we get some benefit coming through on impairment charges and operating expenses.\\nThomas Rayner\\nYes, okay. I'm sorry, just one very final one from me. On the -- you specifically mentioned sort of the mortgage pressure in the U.K. I'm just trying to get a sense of whether you view this as a market phenomenon or is it a real push for market share by you guys, you're happy to maybe trade off that volume margin? Or do you think it's the market itself, it's becoming more competitive?\\nIain Mackay\\nWell, I mean, certainly, this is the area where Francesca and Antonio in the U.K. could give us much more insight and detail on what's happening on a day-to-day basis. But it clearly was a competitive marketplace in 2016, true in '15, that the team in the U.K. engaged much more actively with selected brokers, to give ourselves line of sight to a larger share of the U.K. market. And from a volumes and stock perspective, we grew market share in 2016. And -- but it is clearly competitive from a pricing perspective. I think we had one of the best-priced products in the marketplace in 2016 for a significant period of time. And in the latter, I would say, the latter part of the year or very early this year, we took that particular offering off the marketplace. So it goes back to Stuart's comment. We are absolutely focused on growing our market share in products that we know we can make good returns on. But by the same token, there's a very strong focus on return generation within the business and continue to improve those returns, both in terms on return on risk-weighted assets and the wider capital equation around return on equity. So discipline around net capital deployment is the heightened and increasing level within the firm.\\nOperator\\nOur next question today comes from the line of Martin Leitgeb from Goldman Sachs.\\nMartin Leitgeb\\nI just have 3 questions, and the first one is a follow-up on earlier comments on the rate sensitivity. And I was just wondering if you could give us a steer in terms of currency denomination of your deposit base and to what percentage of your global deposits are denominated in either U.S. dollar or Hong Kong dollar. And obviously, we get the -- we got some steals debt coming from the booking location of the deposits, which would imply slightly shy of 50% on those currencies. But I was just wondering if you could give us an idea if that is the right number or if the number could be meaningfully higher in terms of U.S. dollar, Hong Kong dollar deposit exposure. The second question is to follow up on your just previous comment on Tom's question on the U.K. mortgage space. And I get a bit of sense, looking at pricing relative to market, that it seems like something held you back a little bit during the year in terms of mortgage growth in the U.K. And it seems also that the growth has accelerated in the second half. And I was just wondering if this has to do further with your rollout of intermediary networks and if we should assume that going forward from here, growth in net new mortgage lending in the U.K. would further accelerate. And the final question, also on the U.K., but here, on the current account side. It seems from what we read in the press that the current account offering at this point in time is very competitive in the U.K. And I was just wondering if you could share a bit of detail on this strategy there because looking at the latest account, it seems like that there's quite a substantial deposit overhang in the U.K. And I was just trying to get a sense on what the aim here is in terms of broadening the current account offering.\\nIain Mackay\\nSo I think if I take the last one first. You have seen again the deposit, the AD ratio, asset-deposit ratio sitting just below 68%. We saw significant customer deposit growth across each of our global businesses within 2016, most notably that was within Hong Kong, the wider Asia and the U.K. And so we've got our current accounts and overall savings proposition out there in the marketplace. Customers either like it because it has price or they like it because of the strength of the HSBC balance sheet and the overall security. I think if you were to dispose [ph] it there from a corporate perspective, it's probably the latter. And from a retail customer perspective, it's probably more difficult to point to any particular differentiation in that regard. If you think about overall deposit concentration, the greatest, the most significant deposit surplus that we carry is in Hong Kong. It is the most significant by a long stretch. It is then followed by strong deposit and AD ratios within the U.K. And then latterly, if you work down the list, you sort of come to the U.S. as sort of being third in terms of overall concentration of deposits that are either U.S. dollar directly or U.S. dollar linked. But Hong Kong is the big piece in that equation. I think in terms of mortgage growth in the U.K., there clearly was a focus in 2015 and '16 in terms of expanding our ability to access more of the market from -- in terms of being able to see more of the market in terms of accessing mortgage leads. But in terms of overall growth, it's actually been a fairly steady picture in terms of 2016 versus 2017 where we've grown at a reasonably steady pace from the first quarter of '16 through the second, third and fourth quarters. If you think about this at the beginning of the year, we had slightly less than $93 billion outstanding in U.K. mortgage balances. And at the end of the year, we had about $96 billion, and that's on a constant-currency basis. So overall, we grew the book, but I wouldn't have called it a headlong charge for growth, but there's a very strong balance between underwriting discipline and doing the right thing in terms of appropriate product for the customers in terms of the direction of the U.K. business.\\nMartin Leitgeb\\nAnd on the deposit denomination, is this roughly 50% of the -- what is reflected for the U.S. dollar, Hong Kong dollar exposure?\\nIain Mackay\\nWe'll come back to that. So like I said, the Hong Kong dollar deposits in terms of something linked to the U.S. dollar is the most significant surplus that we've got sitting around the world. I don't have the breakdown of the deposit base globally for the group by currency, but we can come back to you on that one.\\nOperator\\nNext question today comes from Jason Napier from UBS.\\nJason Napier\\nTwo on costs, please, and then one on capital. The sort of enlarged gross cost program and the breakdown of the sort of waterfall there, just wanted to ask again for a little bit more color on the inflation of your rate costs, that's well over $1 billion now versus the original plan. Is there some sense as to what has changed there? I appreciate the comments on taking it as OpEx. I'm just interested in the sort of -- in the way that things have turned out. And likewise, the very substantial increase in transformational savings that you're aiming for strips by division, where that is coming from given the size of the numbers. Secondly, a much easier one, the Corporate Centre costs x levy look reassuringly stable at about $250 million [ph] a quarter. I just wondered if that sort of an underlying $1 billion a year run rate for Corp Centre x levy was about right. And then I have a last question on capital.\\nIain Mackay\\nCan you give me the question on capital?\\nJason Napier\\nCertainly. So -- and I'm afraid I'm really just asking you to rehearse what I think you already said at Q3 around the change in treatment of BoCom. But if I think about some of the comments today, the buyback announced today takes you to 13.5% for CET1. The $8 billion of capital that you've mentioned, you said, is potentially excess in the U.S., it's another 100 basis points, and BoCom is worth a little over 100 in Q3. I'm just trying to understand again whether the sense from yourself is that the change in treatment at the PRA level is in the near term or in the medium term distributable, because that would imply a sort of a new running deck for capital requirement of 11.5%, which I think many investors might regard as too good to be true.\\nIain Mackay\\nSorry, can you grant your rationale for 11.5%? You're suggesting that an appropriate ratio for the group is 11.5% common equity tier 1?\\nJason Napier\\nWell, I'm just trying to check the math. So I think in a response to an earlier question, you said that you suggested that excess capital in the U.S. was $8 billion, so that's 100 basis points. The benefit in Q3 from the PRA has changed to the BoCom treatment was 104 basis points. So kind of where you are now net of those 2 things is 11.5%. And I was just -- wanted to get your sense as to -- yes?\\nIain Mackay\\nOne way to think about it, we've set out a common equity tier 1 ratio target of 12% to 13%. And I think for probably the last 12 to 18 months, we've been pretty clear that probably at the top end of that range is the appropriate place for us to be. Certainly, until some of the regulatory uncertainty that still persists is resolved in an appropriate manner, clearly, it's a little bit disappointing that we didn't get the final guidance on Basel III revisions or Basel IV in January. We'll hopefully get something on that later this year. But no, our common equity tier 1, sitting at 13.5% after this buyback, is 50 basis points above the top end of the range that we would target. So therefore, it kind of comes back to Stuart's comments, when we have capital resources at the group that are in excess of our common equity tier 1 ratio, there's a number of factors we'll consider. One, the investment opportunity at improved return levels within the group, the overall coverage for the dividend and then consider the opportunity for buyback. The other factors that clearly flow into that is where we are with respect to overall stability in the regulatory environment as it relates to capital resources and, more broadly, dealing with uncertainty from a geopolitical perspective and how that could impact the overall revenue and profit generation within the group. So there are -- it is a multifaceted problem that the industry faces, and I think we've got a pretty sensible and sound framework around dealing with that. But do not assume that moving significantly below 13% is something that we would countenance in the short, medium or long term.\\nJason Napier\\nThat's very clear.\\nIain Mackay\\nOkay. From a cost perspective, going to the overall compliance. So the overall regulatory and compliance costs were well beyond the Global Standards. The Global Standards is a significant component of that. And as Stuart pointed out, we continue to invest on delivering our commitments against the U.S. deferred prosecution agreement, the agreement with the Financial Conduct Authority in the U.K. And that is a level of investment that we would expect. And certainly, Colin Bell, who leads that overall focus for us, is firmly of the view that investment in that area will peak in 2017, and that's consistent with previous guidance that we provided in that regard. Other programs that flow into that, stress-testing, we do multiple stress tests around the world for regulators. We had over 60 stress tests last year informed by regulatory guidance. We have our own internal stress testing program that's been running for many years that really informs questions that Marc Moses, our Chief Risk Officer, Stuart, the board have that we stress test against. It also covers implementation of bidding transparency in the United Kingdom. It covers implementation of IFRS 9. It covers CCAR in the United States. So it's a broad base of programs that are dealt with in the regulatory and compliance space. Implementation of a senior manager resumed in the U.K. is another that falls into this area. The area of expanded investment is primarily within the Global Standards program as it relates to anti-money laundering and sanctions control and overall financial crime risk management, and we would expect that investment to peak in 2017. And as Stuart said, we would expect that to become part of the run rate. I think our view is that we will deliver our productivity over time, but we will deliver that productivity over the broader suite of regulatory compliance -- regulatory and compliance programs as opposed to specifically within the Global Standards program. In terms of what's really delivering the cost saves, it's across each of the global businesses focused both on front-office and back-office processes. There is some very significant contribution to the strong -- our technology and operations teams in terms of the efficiency with which our service centers around the world operate, loading and optimization of the workforce within those in terms of getting better efficiency in terms of responding to customer requirements, collection activities, for example. From a technology perspective, the overhaul that Andy Maguire and Darryl West have led across the organization is leading to some significant savings. One of the consequences that you saw from that was the impairment that we took in the fourth quarter against some of the software that we no longer deploy within the business. But it is really across every aspect of the business within the supporting functions, across risk, across finance, we've seen significant savings realized as we improved processes. And really, what we've seen, which has informed the increase of the targets, is not necessarily a proliferation of programs that we've got delivering those efficiencies, but getting greater yield from the programs that we've already launched. Clearly, there are more programs to be launched, but the main contributor is greater yields from programs that we've already had up and running and, frankly, getting better at this as time goes on. I think the other point to make here is this is not about getting at the end of '17, dropping the tools, taking a big rest, slurping back a glass of champagne and congratulating ourselves; but it's about counting that productivity into 2018 and beyond.\\nJason Napier\\nAnd then the last one was Corporate Centre x levy, about $1 billion a year, that feels like a sort of stable-ish number, does it? Or [indiscernible] to the new divisions?\\nIain Mackay\\nIt's not a bad number for '17. But just as the rest of the business is focused on delivering cost savings and better processes, our Corporate Centre is focused on the same thing. So it's not a bad number, but we'll be working on -- we'll be focused on trying to work down a little bit in this cycle as well.\\nDouglas Flint\\nWe've got time for one last question.\\nOperator\\nWe will take our last question today from Stephen Andrews from Deutsche Bank.\\nStephen Andrews\\nJust comes back to that last question on Slide 7 on the Corporate Centre and that $1 billion for the year x levy. Can you just make a comment on the bank levy? I mean, it came in a little bit lower than expectation. You said there was a write-back. What you would expect that to be this year, because I think it was about $300 million better than people's expectations.\\nIain Mackay\\nYes. So the rate dropped. So you'll recall from the budget in 2015, I think, the rate will drop each year from now to 2021 when the basis of assessment will go from the consolidated balance sheet of the group to the U.K. balance sheet of the group. And it is in 2021 when we will realize a significant reduction in the bank levy, assuming that, that budget undertaking in legislation remains in place. What you should expect between now and 2020 is somewhere in the range of $1 billion to $1.1 billion each year for the bank levy.\\nStephen Andrews\\nSo net of the bank levy, we should just really be running that Corporate Centre forward to 0 because it looks like a lot of TLAC costs, the roll-off costs now of the U.S. CML, all of this in that Corporate Centre with the new breakdown, is that correct? So do you think about any contribution at all from the Corporate Centre, which has been positive in the past?\\nIain Mackay\\nI'm sorry, when you say positive, what do you mean?\\nStephen Andrews\\nWell, if you -- if I go to Slide 7 and look at the sort of underlying run rates you're giving on the businesses, you've got the global businesses and the Corporate Centre. And the Corporate Centre, as you rightly pointed out in your comments, is the minus $621 million in the last quarter which was the debt issue.\\nIain Mackay\\nYes.\\nStephen Andrews\\nIf I'm right, what you were saying just now with the previous question was that we're looking about $1 billion, that running at $1 billion for the full year x the levy? Because there was just a lot more drag on that going forward, as you've pointed out. So if you're saying $1 billion for the full year, we take off the $1.1 billion, essentially for the full year, we should be pretty much forecasting that as 0 for the full year at each quarter. I know you don't give forecast, but how we should think about it?\\nIain Mackay\\nSo from an x levy perspective?\\nStephen Andrews\\nYes, no, including levy full year, roughly 0.\\nIain Mackay\\nWell, but remember what's going through the Corporate Centre here. You've got the associates, you've got BoCom, you've got Saudi British Bank, you've got headquarter operating expenses, you've got the net of our corporate -- our global service centers, revenue and expenses coming through that, you've got a proportion of the TLAC cost coming through that, some of which clearly has pushed down to the operating entities as we preposition that. So there are still -- clearly, there's very active tools coming through the Corporate Centre. I mean, x levy, I think the better analysis is the x levy is, from an operating expense perspective, subject to comments I made, is probably $1 billion.\\nStephen Andrews\\nX levy, okay. So including levy, okay.\\nIain Mackay\\nOkay?\\nStephen Andrews\\nYes.\\nDouglas Flint\\nOkay. Thanks, everyone.\\nStuart Gulliver\\nThank you very much.\\nIain Mackay\\nThank you.\\nOperator\\nThank you, ladies and gentlemen, that concludes the call for the HSBC Holdings plc's Annual Results 2016.

For your information, this conference is being recorded.\\nAt this time, I will hand the call over to your host, Mr. Stuart Gulliver, Group Chief Executive.\\nStuart Gulliver\\nThanks very much. So good afternoon from Hong Kong; good morning to everyone in London, and welcome to our first quarter results call. With me today is Iain, who's going to talk through the detailed financial performance. We'll both then take questions, but I'll start by pulling out a few highlights.\\nOur first quarter performance was resilient in market conditions that challenged the entire banking industry. Against the very strong first quarter of 2015, profits were down, although we increased market share in many of the product areas that are critical to our strategy. Market uncertainty led to extreme levels of volatility in January and February, which affected our ability to generate revenue in our Markets and Wealth Management businesses. Both businesses recovered well in March.\\nOur diversified universal banking business model helped to cushion the impact through growth in other parts of the bank. Commercial Banking continued its momentum in spite of the slowdown in global trade, and we increased market share across our strategic trade corridors. We also grew revenue elsewhere in Retail Banking and Wealth Management, particularly current accounts and savings in Hong Kong and the U.K., and personal lending in Asia and Mexico.\\nA combination of tight cost management and the increasing impact of our cost savings programs reduced operating expenses compared to the fourth quarter and kept them broadly unchanged compared to the first quarter of 2015. Loan impairment charges were down by $450 million compared to the fourth quarter and up by $692 million compared to the first quarter of 2015.\\nWe maintained a strong common equity Tier 1 ratio of 11.9%, adding $800 million to capital, net of dividends. We also maintained a strong leverage ratio of 5%. In March, we sold $10.5 billion equivalent of TLAC securities in U.S. dollars and euros across 5 separate tranches in a range of maturities in both fixed and floating format. Our order books were well oversubscribed, in spite of market volatility and difficult new issue conditions, with demand from an extremely broad range of investors. This was the largest senior unsecured fundraising by banks since 2008, and it reopened the benchmark wholesale funding markets for U.K. and European bank holding companies. Our targeted initiatives removed another $15 billion of risk-weighted assets in the first quarter. The risk-weighted assets increased overall due to an increase in corporate lending. There were also higher market volatility, and some corporate credit downgrades also increased risk-weighted assets. We remain on track to hit our risk-weighted asset reduction target.\\nThe technical body of the Brazilian competition agency has now recommended to its board that the sale of our Brazil business be approved. We await a final decision from the competition agency. This is the final regulatory approval required prior to the completion of the transaction. Completing the transaction will add approximately 60 basis points to our common equity Tier 1 ratio.\\nOur Asian businesses continued to gain momentum. We made important market share gains in debt capital markets, China M&A and syndicated lending. We also had strong business wins on the back of our increased investment in Asia, and we extended our leadership in services related to renminbi internationalization.\\nIain is going to now take you through the numbers.\\nIain Mackay\\nThanks, Stuart. Looking quickly at some key metrics for first quarter. The reported return on average ordinary shareholders' equity was 9%. The reported return on average tangible equity was 10.3%; and on an adjusted basis, we had a negative jaws of 2.8%. The movement in jaws was mainly due to a 3.8% decline in adjusted revenue, which exceeded a 1% fall in adjusted costs.\\nThis next slide takes us from reported to adjusted. Reported profit before tax of $6.1 billion for the first quarter included a $1.2 billion gain for fair value on our own debt relating to credit spread and $479 million of other significant items. Allowing for these items leaves an adjusted profit before tax of $5.4 billion for the first quarter. You'll find more details on these adjustments in the appendix. And we'll focus on adjusted numbers for the remainder of this presentation.\\nThis next slide shows a comparison with the fourth quarter of 2015. Adjusted profit before tax was $3.6 billion higher than the fourth quarter due to higher revenue, lower loan impairment charges and costs. You'll recall that the bank levy influences the fourth quarter numbers. Excluding the bank levy, operating expenses fell by $236 million. Loan impairment charges were $450 million lower, mainly in Commercial Banking. The fourth quarter included an increase in specific loan impairment charges in a small number of countries, which largely affected local factors and collective charges relating to oil and gas.\\nSlide 6 breaks down adjusted profit by global business and geography on a period-by-period basis. These profits were achieved in challenging market conditions and relative to a very strong first quarter last year. The main business drivers of the reduction in profit were lower revenue in Global Banking and Markets and Retail Banking and Wealth Management. An increased loan impairment charges in the Global Banking and Markets principally related to oil and gas and metals and mining.\\nWe've split out Brazil from the rest of the group here to show the impact that it had on our numbers in the first quarter. This also gives you a basis for comparison from when Brazil drops out of our numbers following completion of the transaction. We expect this would have positive impact on operating expenses, loan impairment charges and capital.\\nSlide 7 shows an analysis of revenue. As Stuart said earlier, conditions in the first 2 months of the year were difficult, particularly in our Markets business and Wealth Management. There was a clear improvement in March, however, and that continued into April. You'll recall that our performance in the first quarter of 2015 included the positive impact of the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect; and the strong renminbi market, which benefited us more than most. It's worth noting that our revenues are down no more than the industry average in spite of this.\\nIn Principal Retail Banking and Wealth Management, revenue was $270 million or 5% lower than the first quarter of 2015. This was mainly in Wealth Management, caused by the impact of adverse movements in interest rates in equity markets and life insurance as well as lower customer activity. We did, however, grow revenue from customer accounts in Hong Kong and the U.K. and from higher personal lending in Latin America and Asia.\\nCommercial Banking revenue continued to grow, driven by higher average balances in Payments and Cash Management and further loan growth. Client-facing global banks and markets revenue was down by $286 million or 7% compared to a strong performance in the prior year. In common with the rest of the banking industry, extreme levels of market volatility led to reduced client activity in our markets business, particularly in equities and credit and foreign exchange. Revenue was up in rates. There was a $172 million reduction in revenue from Balance Sheet Management due in large part to lower gains on disposal of available-for-sale securities. Global Private Banking revenue is down by $87 million or 15% due to lower brokerage and trading activity in Europe and Asia. However, we attracted $4 billion of net new money in the quarter.\\nOther provided $179 million of revenue in the first quarter. This included favorable fair value movements associated with long-term debt issued by HSBC Holdings. These are related to interest and exchange rate risk but not our own credit spread, which we excluded from adjusted performance. In last year's first quarter, Other had losses of $200 million, mainly from the adverse impact of certain intra-group adjustments. This means that revenue for Other was up by $379 million on a quarter-by-quarter basis.\\nLoan impairment charges were $692 million higher than the first quarter of 2015 but $450 million lower than the fourth quarter. $159 million of the increase on the first quarter of 2015 came specifically from Brazil due to difficult economic and trading conditions. These were mostly collectively assessed impairments in Retail Banking and Wealth Management.\\nThe increase also includes an adjustment of around $100 million in our U.S. runoff portfolio. Charges in wholesale were up by $380 million. Q1 included additional specific charges related to oil and gas, mainly in the U.S. and Canada. There was also a charge in Australia relating to metals and mining as well as higher specific charges in a small number of countries. As the chart shows, the level of loans reported as past due but not impaired continues to reflect our risk management. And as we said at our annual results, we continue to monitor oil and gas sector closely and to manage our exposures accordingly. There's a detailed overview of our oil and gas and metals and mining exposure in the appendix.\\nAdjusted operating expenses were $76 million or 1% lower than the first quarter of 2015. Excluding bank levy adjustments in each period, we were successful in keeping costs broadly unchanged in spite of the effects of inflation and $743 million of investment in regulatory programs and compliance.\\nThis investment reflected the continued implementation of our Global Standards program and other requirements. And as we said in June, we expect this investment to continue throughout 2016 and to flatten in 2017 as increased automation and process improvements take effect.\\nYou'll recall that our cost savings program is designed to cover the cost of investments in Global Standards, investment in growth and the impact of inflation as well as to achieve an exit rate equivalent to 2014 by the end of 2017.\\nIn Commercial Banking, our cost reduction initiatives neutralized the effect of both inflation and increased investment in Global Standards. These included our simplified organization structure and process optimization within our lending, onboarding and servicing platforms.\\nCosts were down marginally in Retail Bank Wealth Management as investments in our Asia branch network and inflationary pressures were more than offset by cost savings, including our digital transformation and branch optimization programs. Costs fell in Global Banking and Markets due primarily to lower staff performance costs in Asia, Europe and the United States.\\nThis continues the good start that we made to our cost saving program, and we remain confident of hitting our cost target. Rebased for currency translation and the sale of Brazil, that target is now $29.1 billion.\\nTurning to capital. The group's common equity Tier 1 ratio was maintained at 11.9%. We increased common equity Tier 1 capital by $2 billion in the first quarter. This was from capital generation through profits, net of dividends, of around $800 million. And we benefited from favorable foreign currency translation differences of $1 billion. While total risk-weighted assets increased in the first quarter, we continued to make progress with our risk-weighted assets initiatives. The next slide sets out the movements in more detail.\\nThe increase in risk-weighted assets in the first quarter was a result of book size and quality. Growth in book size was mainly driven by 2 things: increased corporate lending, mainly in Commercial Banking and Global Banking and Markets; and increased market volatility and client activity, impacting counterparty credit risk and market risk. Each of these accounted for around half of the movement in book size. Book quality represents risk-weighted asset movements due to changes in the underlying credit quality of our customers.\\nThese movements were partially offset by the -- by our continued progress in RWA initiatives. Our investor -- at our investor update in 2015, we set a target to reduce group's risk-weighted assets by $290 billion by the end of 2017. The chart on the top right of the page shows this target adjusted for the latest foreign exchange rates. This gives a rebased target of $279 billion. Since the start of 2015, we've reduced risk-weighted assets by $139 billion, of which $15 billion was in the first quarter of this year. These reductions include legacy credit and U.S. runoff portfolios. Our risk-weighted asset reduction plans are on track, and we remain confident of hitting our targets by the end of 2017.\\nThe reported return on risk-weighted assets was 2.2% compared to 2.4% in the first quarter of 2015. We continue to work towards an adjusted return on risk-weighted assets of greater than 2.3% by 2017.\\nI'll now hand back to Stuart.\\nStuart Gulliver\\nThank you. This slide provides a summary of our progress in the 11 months since our investor update. Iain has already talked about risk-weighted assets and I've already talked about Brazil, so I'm going to concentrate on the other actions here.\\nOur U.S. and Mexico businesses are heading in the right direction. Adjusted profits in our principal U.S. business grew by 29% to $181 million largely due to lower operating expenses. Revenue was up by another 4%. And we've continued to make solid progress in running down our U.S. CML legacy portfolio, including the disposal of a $1.4 billion tranche in April.\\nIn Mexico, adjusted profit before tax of $72 million was up 104% on the first quarter of 2015. This was due to higher lending balances in Retail Banking and Wealth Management, higher insurance revenues and improved collaboration between Retail Banking and Wealth Management and Commercial Banking. We're also gaining good traction in terms of cross-border business in the area recovered by NAFTA. We have double-digit growth in Commercial Banking across the free trade zone, and we're currently winning around 3 out of 4 cross-border deals in the region.\\nAs Iain has already said, we've made good progress in operating expenses while continuing to invest in growth initiatives and regulatory programs and compliance.\\nAll of our cost programs are now underway. We have reduced employee numbers by around 6,000 since the first quarter of last year. And the sale of Brazil will reduce FTEs by a further 19,000 to bring the group total to 235,000. This compares with 295,000 on the 31st December 2010. As this trend illustrates, we've got a good grip on costs. Although progress will not be linear, we're confident of hitting our target by the end of 2017.\\nOur Payments and Cash Management business maintained its strong momentum with an increase of 7% on the first quarter of last year. And Global Trade and Receivables Finance maintained its position in a slow trade environment and captured additional market share across our top 23 strategic corridors. In the first quarter, we also received clearance to offer our own credit cards in mainland China.\\nAdjusted profit before tax was $357 million in ASEAN, which was up 14% due to lower LICs and lower costs. We have also increased assets under management in Asia by 10% in the first quarter and grew revenue from insurance manufacturing new business premiums in Asia by 18% to around USD 600 million. Revenue from renminbi internationalization was down, but we have strengthened our leadership position in the quarter. I'll talk more about this on the next slide.\\nSlide 14 shows the numbers behind the story. We've increased our market shares across a number of product lines, as we've invested in the business and as competitors have withdrawn from some of our core markets. In the first quarter, we held our share of the market in Global Trade and Receivables Finance but increased our market share in 4 out of 5 regions in documentary trade. We also strengthened our leadership position in Payments and Cash Management. We are a market leader in Asia advisory business and have strengthened that position considerably. We're the established #1 underwriter in debt capital markets, and we've retained our #1 ranking for syndicated loans in Hong Kong and Mainland China and further increased our market share there. We've also dramatically increased our share of the Asian M&A market.\\nFinally, we've retained our #1 position in the league tables for offshore renminbi bonds and have a 52% share of the Securities Services RQFII market. This puts us in an excellent position not just to benefit from a more stable renminbi market, but from the relaxation of investment barriers for onshore bonds and the likely rollout of the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect later this year. No other bank is in this strong position to capitalize on these opportunities.\\nIn summary, we've shown resilience and made further progress towards the completion of our strategic actions. We intend to keep reporting on this progress on a quarterly basis.\\nThe market volatility that affected the first 2 months of the year has largely stabilized. March was a better month than both January and February, and April has continued in broadly the same vein. Despite the difficult conditions, our diversified and balanced business has enabled us to continue to generate growth and to capture market share where possible.\\nThere continues to be plenty of revenue opportunities available to us in the coming quarters, particularly in the areas that we are targeting for growth. The planned Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect and the opening up of the China interbank bond market will enable us to capitalize on our market access in Asia. The increase in Chinese ODI and M&A involving Chinese firms plays to our leadership of the Asian advisory market. And the rollout of the Belt and Road initiative and the growth of green finance will create opportunities in infrastructure finance and green bonds, both of which are already significant areas of strength for HSBC.\\nWe are confident of achieving our target of $4.5 billion to $5 billion of cost savings by the end of 2017. And our strong balance sheet gives us the latitude to manage the business for the long term in accordance with our strategy.\\nWe'll now take questions. The operator will explain the procedure and then introduce the first question. Operator?\\nOperator\\n[Operator Instructions] We will now take our first question today from Alastair Ryan from Bank of America.\\nAlastair Ryan\\nTwo from me, please. First, the net interest margin sounds like it's stabilizing underlying in the quarter but down a bit on a reported basis. Ex Brazil, now that the feds started hiking rates, if only a little, can you give us any sense of whether you've hit the bottom on the margin? There's been a sort of a long downdraft. Has rate hit 0? And second, on trade, you sound a bit more downbeat in the text but a bit more positive on this call. Can you give us a sense where you think your trade revenues are headed across volumes and margins, please?\\nIain Mackay\\nYes, on net interest margin, Alastair, very, very stable compared to the fourth quarter of last year. And I think that can be true really across all of the main product lines with respect to NIMs. I think going forward one of the things that will create a little bit of pressure on NIM at a group level is the cost of TLAC. And we talked about that at the end of the year and going forward, but when you look at it on a trading basis, the net interest margin has been very stable in the fourth quarter. And certainly, there were no indications of particular pressure coming through beyond some of the factors that we talked about a few weeks ago when we released the full year numbers, so very consistent.\\nStuart Gulliver\\nSo going on trade. So the overall macro backdrop, as you know, is that trade growth was very sluggish, with about 2.8% growth for last year, in 2015, and actually quite a sharp decline in the value of trade by about 13%. Those are overall WTO numbers. What we've seen within our business is that growth in trade within Global Banking and Markets, where revenue is up about 3%; and a decline in CMB, where revenue was down about 6%. But if you dig into it, there's a decline in documentary trade balances, which are down about 13%, but actually structured trade finance, receivables finance is up about 15%. Now actually, that's longer-term positive for margins because documentary credits have been extremely competitive with very, very tight margins. So as the market moves towards structured trade and receivables finance, that actually should offer some revenue growth. As it stands, we've grown market share. The HKMA data here suggests that the overall market for trade balances, this is February '16 Hong Kong Monetary Authority number, was down about 34% in Hong Kong. And we're down about 9% in Hong Kong, which indicates that we've taken market share. So to be honest, we are slightly more positive than perhaps the text suggests, but it's a complicated picture. But what we can see is that we're outperforming the overall market across all 23 of our strategic trade corridors, and our declines are considerably less than the market is showing. And there's a switch from documentary credits towards structured trade, which itself has better margins.\\nOperator\\nOur next question today comes from Raul Sinha from JPMorgan.\\nRaul Sinha\\nStuart, Iain, can I have a couple of questions, please, for the revenues? The first one is on Page 20 of your release, where you talk about Principal RBWM. And I particularly wanted to focus on wealth products, where you obviously had $1.2 billion of top line this quarter. And that was one of the areas which was impacted by the volatility. But if you look at your -- the comps against last year, for example, last year, you had $1.9 billion of revenues in this business in the second quarter, presumably helped by the China bull market. So I was just wondering if you can talk a little bit about the outlook for this business, what -- how would you characterize your performance in the first quarter here? And how should we expect this to move going forward?\\nIain Mackay\\nYes, Raul, I think one of the things to bear in mind about the first quarter of last year was an incredibly strong performance coming through in the back of the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect, which represent a significant uplift to revenues coming through retail bank Wealth Management in the Asian market, specifically Wealth Management. The other feature that, again, added a somewhat positive effect overall on PVIF coming through in the first quarter of last year, we saw almost the exact opposite in the first quarter of 2016. And when you look at the overall impact on retail bank Wealth Management revenues, that's really what it boils down to; is a -- market updates coming through PVIF in the insurance manufacturing businesses, and that is mostly within Hong Kong and France; and then the impact of lower brokerage revenues. When you look at the performance coming through, if you like, the installed base of current accounts, deposit accounts, mortgages, unsecured personal lending, overall the outlook remains fairly stable across each of the major markets for us. The U.K. has been reasonably positive for us in the first quarter. Hong Kong, for fairly obvious reasons, has been a little bit slower, but the main drivers of the lower revenues have been the 2 features and the comparison to first quarter of last year.\\nStuart Gulliver\\nIt's worth bearing in mind that it's a combination of Retail Banking and Wealth Management, as the name suggests. So the Wealth Management piece, as Iain's just outlined, is kind of weak because we had such a strong first and second quarter of last year, but actually, we've got good growth in current accounts and savings and in personal lending. So if you look at the Retail Banking piece, current account, savings and deposits, if you're on Page 20, you can see growth. And you can also see growth in the personal lending piece. So actually, it's not an -- it's not just the Wealth Management business. It's both the Retail Banking, i.e. deposits and loans; as well as the Wealth Management piece. Your second question, Raul?\\nRaul Sinha\\nOkay. And then just on that sort of leading into the jaws and your outlook for positive jaws for this year. Obviously, costs down 2% ex the investment in reg spend and the levy credit, and revs down 4% underlying. I guess you probably want to narrow and turn that round as the year progresses, but I suspect you'd probably need a little bit of help from the revenue environment. Or is there something that I'm missing in terms of costs that we should expect the cost momentum to build as we move through the year?\\nIain Mackay\\nI think a little bit of help on the revenue line would certainly be appreciated. The focus on the costs is to hit the $4.5 billion to $5 billion of cost take-outs by the end of 2017 such that we get that 2014 run rate. There's good traction around that. We've got all the programs up and running, so the focus is very much in making sure that we can stay on top of and execute against the things we control. That being said, within the revenue space, a little bit of help would be appreciated, but again, I think if you look at the underlying development of Commercial Banking, in the first quarter, it was reasonably encouraging when you consider the underlying trading conditions. Overall, looking at Global Banking and Markets, excluding Balance Sheet Management, down 7%, which I think is a bit of a standout on an industry comparison perspective. And we clearly saw some of the stabilization coming through in our March revenues, and that has been broadly sustained through April. And then retail bank Wealth Management, again there's a very strong focus from John and the team in terms of, one, executing against the -- their share of the $4.5 billion to $5 billion in terms of managing the overall cost equation; and also, obviously, a focus on continuing to build the customer relationships that support revenue. So we're not necessarily depending on a significant upgrade in rates, but clearly, a slightly more stable, less-volatile environment coming out of the first quarter into second will, hopefully, be helpful.\\nOperator\\nOur next question today comes from the line of Chira Barua from Bernstein.\\nChirantan Barua\\nJust a quick one on Hong Kong. I've been following this for a long time. This is the first quarter after ages that I've seen Hong Kong loan growth down across retail, commercial, global markets, Private Banking sequentially, so it will be great to get some color on what's happening. Stuart, your comments on trade, very helpful; the same on the retail side or the commercial side in terms of growth. What are the dependencies into, not only this quarter, this year going forward would be much appreciated.\\nIain Mackay\\nI think there's probably not a great deal that we can add, Chira, on top of what we've answered the last couple of questions here. I think what we saw, certainly within the retail bank Wealth Management space in Hong Kong, was a growth in current accounts. And one suspects that that's a feature of many of our customers sitting in the sideline, waiting to see slightly more stable environment for investing, which certainly should help support the Wealth Management revenue equation going forward in slightly more stable markets. So that's certainly an expectation that we'd like to see. Overall, Commercial Banking continues to perform reasonably well. And Global Banking and Markets in Asia was afflicted with the same sort of underlying trends that we saw coming through our European and U.S. business. And improvements that we've seen coming through March and April in that regard, again, are somewhat encouraging. And it can -- it goes without saying that Peter and the team in Asia are -- continue to be very closely focused on the overall cost management picture. Also, we do have a very robust 39% cost efficiency ratio within the Hong Kong market. I think the overall -- the other thing that's worth mentioning is that within our ASEAN markets, we saw an improvement in PBT over the course of the first quarter, with lower loan impairment charges and good cost control across the businesses and reasonably constructive revenue environment. So notwithstanding the fact that Hong Kong is hugely important, there is more than just one arrow in the quiver on this front.\\nOperator\\nOur next question today comes from David Lock from Deutsche Bank.\\nDavid Lock\\nThree quick ones from me, please. First of all, on rates. It looks like you had a very strong performance in the quarter; about 20% up. I just wondered, within the context of your commentary about the first 2 months of the year being a bit weaker and the third month being a bit better and that continuing, if you'd give a little bit of color about that rates performance. Should we expect that to be sustained into the second quarter? Second question is on costs to achieve. I think, so far, you've taken about $1.3 billion since the beginning of 2015, so probably a little bit behind the $4 billion to $4.5 billion run rate. So I just wondered if you could update us on the phasing of that and when we might expect that to flow through. And then thirdly, on GBM Balance Sheet Management. I think, in the past, you've given us a little guidance on how we should expect that to evolve over the course of the year. I just wondered if you had any views at the first quarter on what we might expect for BSM this year.\\nStuart Gulliver\\nSo Balance Sheet Management, about $2.5 billion. Rates, no, I don't think you can extrapolate that forward. What I think you can more look at is the recovery in foreign exchange, credit and equities. Remember total client-facing Global Banking and Markets revenues were only down 7%, which actually, as Iain was saying earlier, compared to most of the industry, was a very strong performance. Our GBM business, as we've been saying kind of repeatedly for a very long term, has a kind of different mixture. If you add in Balance Sheet Management, the overall adjusted revenues for the business are down 12%. I don't think that you should be assuming a continued outperformance from rates but more that in March and April, more normalized trading conditions return, so helping the foreign exchange and equity piece more.\\nIain Mackay\\nOn CTA, David, I wouldn't necessarily expect absolute linearity into -- coming through the cost to achieve; just as we've talked about, not -- hopefully, not anticipating exact linearity coming through in the actual costs being realized. What I would say is that normally, on the basis that we're going to recognize our $4.5 billion to $5 billion of saves by the end of 2017, you can expect the cost to achieve to come through slightly ahead in terms of the actual cost savings. So we're about 1 -- just over $1.2 billion since inception through to the current point. And there is -- I think Stuart mentioned it in his comments, all of the programs and projects that we've got focused on realizing cost saves are up now and -- are up and running now, and as a consequence of which, we'll continue to see the cost to achieve coming through over the course of the coming quarters.\\nOperator\\nOur next question today comes from Tom Rayner from Exane.\\nThomas Rayner\\nCan I have 2 questions, please? First, to just go back to Hong Kong, see if I can get any more out of you. I mean it accounted for about 38% of group profit in the first quarter. The loan book looks like it's contracted, annualized, 13% in Q1, commercial itself down 20% on an annualized run rate, so either something has happened in the first quarter to explain that or it looks like a fairly big sort of retrenching in terms of your sort of appetite to lend. I noticed the loan-to-deposit ratio has fallen from 56% a year ago to about 48% now. So I just wondered if I could push you a bit more for some comments on what's happening in Hong Kong specifically. And I have a second question, on Slide 11, which is the RWA slide. I don't know if you want that now or to take it separately.\\nIain Mackay\\nHang on, Tom. On Tom, we -- on Hong Kong, we had a number of large corporate repayments in the first quarter of the year. I think the other thing that would have characterized the first quarter was relatively low demand for credits. And I think, again, that kind of goes to some of the things we've already talked about with respect to retail bank Wealth Management as well as Global Banking and Markets. But the main feature that we saw in terms of really impacting balance sheet was a little bit of corporate repayment coming through the first quarter and lower demand. It certainly wasn't specifically as a consequence of a reduction in risk appetite from the Asian businesses perspective. We also saw slightly lower mortgages. As you've seen coming through a lot of the media coverage, there's an expectation of declining property prices within the Hong Kong environment. And again, just a little bit of risk aversion with respect to part of our customers waiting to see if the environment settles down is probably the best way to characterize that at the moment, Tom.\\nStuart Gulliver\\nAnd another thing, Tom, that you'd have had in the first quarter of 2015, which is related to -- and in the second quarter of 2015, which is related to Hong Kong-Shanghai Stock Connect, is actually quite a lot of margin lending against equities, which clearly wasn't repeated in the first quarter of this year, which also would explain a chunk of the reduction in loans and advances.\\nThomas Rayner\\nSure. Okay, so when you sort of strip through all of that, I mean, are you looking at a reasonably stable loan book, do you think; or a small contraction or small growth? What's your sort of gut feel for the true underlying sort of business that is...\\nStuart Gulliver\\nI think, flat, to be honest, Tom, flat. Flat.\\nThomas Rayner\\nFlattish, yes, okay. Okay. Slide 11, I just wonder if you could add a bit more color to some of the big moving parts in reconciling the RWA movements. I know there's some explanation in the text. The increase due to book size, given again little real growth in the loan book, looks quite large. And then there's possibly the corporate downgrades driving the quality. Is there anything else you can add to what's going on to give us a feel for what we should be thinking about for the rest of the year on some of those drivers, please?\\nIain Mackay\\nIn terms of book size, Tom, there was about 50% of that came from actually growing lending. And that's made up across the north -- well, the U.S., in the U.K. and in Mexico were the main drivers in terms of growth coming through from a book size perspective. And then what you also have is obviously some step-up in market risk -- risk-weighted assets coming through, some of the volatility that we saw in the first quarter reflected at VaR and stressed VaR and then counterparty credit risk. That's really what we saw going on. So of that $16 billion book size, about 50-50 was split between actual growth in credits and lending to customers and then market volatility effects coming through, principally market risk and counterparty credit risk. And then book quality was really a reflection of the downgrades that we saw happening across both the oil and gas sector and the metals and mining sector principally, which again, when you look at the external factors, you would generally have expected to that -- to see that coming through.\\nThomas Rayner\\nSo if I -- is it fair to say then, if I'm thinking about going forward, the $9 billion of book quality won't necessarily repeat; and half of that increase in book size is volatility which might reverse, might get worse but it's not something which you should expect quarter in, quarter out?\\nIain Mackay\\nNo. I think it is that the aspect of market volatility is going to be driven by exactly that, but there's not necessarily an expectation of repetition around that. I think one of the other things that you need to bear in mind when you're looking at the balance sheet, Tom, is that, in the first quarter, we transferred almost $6 billion out of loans and advances to customers or held for sale, and that came out of our legacy book in Global Banking and Markets and out of our run-off CML portfolio. The majority of that, the vast majority, 80% of it, coming out of the CML portfolio in the U.S.\\nOperator\\nOur next question today comes from Rohith Chandra-Rajan from Barclays.\\nRohith Chandra-Rajan\\nA couple, if I could, please. The first one, just on costs. Obviously, good performance there, helping to offset some of the revenue pressures. Just wondering on the sort of $7.5 billion underlying costs, how feasible that is to hold that relatively flat throughout the rest of the year. Obviously, you've got the bank levy in the fourth quarter, but at the moment, you're being able to offset the regulatory spend and inflation through ongoing cost reductions. So just a comment on how you see that progressing through the year. And then just on the RWA side of things, you highlight that you're halfway through the reduction plan. Could you just give us some insight as to what you expect for the rest of the year? And then secondly, also on timing of Brazil, I mean it sounds like you're now quite close to that being finalized. Is the middle of the year realistic? And can you remind us on the RWA reduction there, please?\\nIain Mackay\\nYes, on Brazil, I think we're looking to -- our expectation is that we'll close in the first half of the year, so by the time we speak to you next, hopefully, we will have that transaction closed and the benefits coming through both the P&L and capital. And that's really one of the reasons that we provided a little bit more insight on the impact on the Brazilian numbers in the overall group so that you can track it through each of the 4 quarters this year. In terms of the RWA reduction, I think it was about $30 billion, if I remember correctly. We'll dig that one out for you. And then in terms of impact on capital overall, it's about 60 basis points. On RWA -- sorry, it was $37 billion coming through the risk-weighted assets on the disposal of Brazil. In terms of progress in RWAs for the remainder of the year, I'd probably sum it up in one word: progress. $15 billion in the first quarter. Obviously, we've made good progress, as Stuart mentioned, in terms of getting more out of the CML portfolio in the month of April. And as I just mentioned, we've transferred a substantial additional balance to held for sale out of the CML book. And that continues at pace. The U.S. team has done a great job there. And we'll continue to make progress with the Global Banking and Markets business, both in terms of legacy portfolio as well as just continued improved management of the capital efficiency across the various models that we've got and the customer base that we've got in RWAs. But as I mentioned, it's not something that we are planning from a linear perspective.\\nStuart Gulliver\\nYes, look, it's not linear, but if you just look at some stats: Global Banking and Markets has achieved 60% of its target already, so $84 billion out of a $141 billion target; CMB, 85% of its target has been achieved, so $25.4 billion out of $30 billion; and the U.S. CMLs, 43% of its 2015 to '17 target achieved. So as Iain says, this is not going to be equal parts month by month, but this is a huge focus.\\nIain Mackay\\nAnd on the costs, Rohith, we will -- we did not actually expect to keep costs flat over the remainder of the year. I think clearly what you saw in the first quarter in terms of Global Banking and Markets, our costs are managed there, certainly in line with overall revenues when it comes to the performance. The performance cost for employees, if the revenue doesn't come through, then the accrual for bonus doesn't come through with it. But broadly speaking, as we talked about back in June of last year and again today, we continue to invest significantly in Global Standards and wider regulatory programs. There's an investment cycle which would provide a little bit more detail about back last June, and we expect that investment cycle to continue through 2016 and really only start to realize significant benefits in terms of lower costs in that particular space as we work through 2017. So we feel there was great progress made in the first quarter of 2016. We do have investment programs that we need to continue through the remainder of '16. And that will put some upward pressure on the overall cost base for the remainder of this year.\\nRohith Chandra-Rajan\\nSo just on that, Iain, sorry. So the regulatory program and compliance costs of $0.7 billion in the quarter, you'd expect to trend up a bit from here. Is that what you're saying?\\nIain Mackay\\nWe do as that investment continues apace. And most of the investment is focused around the deployment of technology and automation into the countries in which we operate today. And as we get to that point, then the overall cost of compliance, we expect to be much more manageable; and possibly to see marginal, but only marginal reductions in the overall costs associated with that. But the investment cycle continues through '16, and we'll start to realize the benefits of that in '17.\\nOperator\\nOur next question today comes from Manus Costello from Autonomous.\\nManus Costello\\nI had a question about your AT1 issuance, please. There was a report in the press last week that the regulator had asked you to issue and you had politely declined. I wondered if you wanted to comment on that incident and more generally comment on what your calendar is like for issuing AT1. Because you've obviously still got a reasonable amount to issue before you hit your target.\\nIain Mackay\\nWell, first of all, I'd say don't believe everything you read in the FT. A fairest point would be a misquoted in an off-the-record conversation. Our regulator did not specifically request us to make issuance into the market, although a number of our investors did. I can well imagine the motivation behind that considering the higher premiums that have been associated with those kinds of issuances back in January and February. Insofar as our AT1 calendar goes, we would expect -- provided pricing is reasonably good, which it actually is at this precise moment in time, we would expect to be out in the market this quarter for AT1s, Tier 2s and other TLAC qualifying securities. We got $10.5 billion out in the first quarter at slightly higher sort of spreads than we would necessarily have liked, but they came in quite nicely at the end of February and into March. So we got $10.5 billion out. And certainly, in terms of volume of issuance through the second quarter, it would be similar or possibly slightly more in the second quarter. When you think overall at our program of issuance, we've got, over the next 3 years, about $50 billion of maturity coming through for refinancing. And then on top of that, we've got somewhere between $10 billion and $30 billion of new issuance to do to ensure that we meet the overall TLAC requirements by the beginning of 2019. And clearly, our view is to try and get as much of a jump on that in 2016 as we can provided the market conditions are reasonably supportive of that.\\nManus Costello\\nAnd when you talked earlier, Iain, about the pressure on the net interest margin from that coming through, are you implying that should start from kind of Q2 as that $10 billion starts to bite?\\nIain Mackay\\nWell, we've put $10.5 billion out. And we'll be paying the coupons on that as time passes, Manus, so yes, the cost of issuing that paper, which, as we've described in numerous occasions before, is surplus to our requirements, will create a little bit of pressure on the NIM.\\nOperator\\nOur next question today comes from Martin Leitgeb from Goldman Sachs.\\nMartin Leitgeb\\nJust a few follow-up question on revenues, please. And your comments obviously on Hong Kong and the loan growth outlook there is helpful. Just looking at Slide 17, where you present underlying loan figures on a constant-currency basis excluding the red-inked balances. And the numbers there look fairly stable over the last 5 quarters. And I was just wondering if you could give us any view on how this could progress from here, with obviously particular trade balances probably -- or potentially stabilizing at the lower level. And in particular, I would be interested in your comments, one, on the potential for loan growth within the U.K.; and in the U.K. specifically, mortgages. Just looking at your disclosure, it appears that deposits kept growing whilst the loan balances, at least on the retail side, kept fairly stable. Do you see the scope there to utilize your competitive funding advantage you have in the U.K. to engage in stronger mortgage grow in the U.K. here going forward? And the second question, on trade finance and element related to commodity prices. With some of the major commodities having quite a rebound in the first quarter, could we see here trade balances expand going forward?\\nStuart Gulliver\\nSo on U.K. mortgages, actually, U.K. mortgage new business is up about 57% year-on-year. There's actually about a $2 billion, nearly $3 billion increase in mortgages. So yes, we are trying to do that. And we've signed up more third-party agents in the first quarter as well. And we've also seen a considerable increase in the number of mortgages coming through on our direct channel, which is actually starting to pick up quite significantly. So yes, we are focused on doing that. So as I say, intermediary performance is up. New business is up. And the amount being onboarded online is also up, so we are trying to do that. If you come to your piece about -- or your question about trade balances and commodity prices, yes, that should really result in some kind of rebound. A big chunk of the documentary credit fall is related to softer commodity prices and actually just lower shipments taking place of commodities. And I think also that the ability to grow the book in U.K., Europe and North America and in Mexico, you can see, in the first quarter, that actually is where we've seen loan growth. Remember also running through these numbers, as we set out on Slide 17, is going in the other direction, obviously, the reduction in the U.S. legacy portfolios, so there is a net reduction going through as we dispose of this as well and as we dispose of legacy assets. So I mean I think we're reasonably confident that we can continue to grow loans and advances and that there is -- as you say, there's a stable picture over the last 5 quarters, there's not a declining picture, within which we may basically offset the declines due to disposals of legacy positions.\\nOperator\\nOur next question today comes from Michael Helsby from Bank of America.\\nMichael Helsby\\nI've got 3 questions: 2 bigger picture; 1 is just a point of detail, please. Firstly, on -- just on ROE, Slide 9. Your costs ex Brazil, you're pretty much already at your 2017 run rate. And despite that, when I look at Slide 12, it shows that your group ROE, excluding significant items and levy, is just 7.6%. So I appreciate that the revenue environment was challenged in the first quarter, but there's a trend where it's been challenged for a while. So I guess the question for me is what's plan B? It really doesn't look like you're going to get anywhere close to your greater-than-10% ROE target, so can you come back to that $7.3 billion cost run rate and make it significantly lower? That's question one. Question two is on Slide 15. You're talking about dividend growth, and you're linking it to longer-term profitability. I asked this last quarter, and your shares are yielding more now since then. Is 8% -- clearly, the market's very worried that you're going to cut the dividend, not grow the dividend, so my question really is what's the longer-term earnings power that you would need to believe in for you to recommend that the board does actually do what the market's worrying about and cut the dividend? And then the third question is just on tax rate. The tax rate was 25.7% this quarter. You mentioned that was because of the U.K. surcharge. Should we use that now as the ongoing tax rate on a clean basis? I just ask as consensus has only got 23%.\\nIain Mackay\\nYes. On the last question, yes, I would use that 25% to 26% as a effective tax rate going forward, informed largely by the U.K. corporate surcharge on taxes. I think, on the ROE, Michael, there's a couple things to bear in mind. That ROE includes really the effect of Brazil coming through. And as we dispose of Brazil, that knocks -- that adds about 20 basis points to return on risk-weighted assets, largely coming through the retail bank and the Commercial Banking businesses. And so that is helpful both in terms of the returns equation as well as the capital and the expense equation. On the costs, you make the assumption that we're pretty much done on costs, and that simply is not the case. We -- the $7.5 billion versus the $7.3 billion belies the fact that we've got continued investment to do in growth initiatives that focus on the longer-term revenue-generating and profit-generating capability of the group. It also focuses on the longer-term requirements for investment around Global Standards and regulatory programs and the offset of inflation. So there remains a very significant piece of work to do from a cost perspective. And delivering against that and at an exit run rate in 2017 equivalent to 2014, whilst continuing to build the balance sheet, albeit perhaps at somewhat slower rates, should increment revenues as we work through those. And I think when you take those factors together and hopefully, but not necessarily planning for a little bit of assistance from U.S. rates, then the mathematics would suggest to us that we can move back towards that 10% rate and, hopefully, grow beyond that. But I think, within the context of 2017, getting there is obviously a pretty difficult challenge, but that's what we're focused on delivering against and a particularly strong focus on those things that are directly within our control; and then taking advantage of any revenue growth opportunities, for example, those that Stuart laid out earlier on. The guidance on dividends hasn't changed, Michael. And it's not going to change unless there's a culmination of factors relating to a wider recessionary environment in the markets in which we operate or a significantly higher set of capital requirements. And as you know, notwithstanding various policy setters' proclamations to the effect that there is no Basel IV, there would certainly seem to be a Basel IV out there with a wide range of reassessment that's in the process of being consulted upon. So I think, until we get capital requirements nailed down, which a year ago I was optimistic we'd be much closer, but I think the events over the last few months have perhaps moved that out into future, sadly, but the guidance on dividends hasn't changed. And if the underlying economic factors and performance factors do change significantly, then we will certainly update you on that, but no change at this point.\\nMichael Helsby\\nSo just on the -- sorry, my first question, Iain. I appreciate there's a lot going on in the cost line, but I guess what I'm trying to get to is if the revenue picture doesn't improve, then clearly, you're only left with one lever to get to your ROE, and that's costs. So I guess the question is to what extent can you lower that $7.3 billion run rate? Is it just off the table because it's too difficult and you're working so hard to deliver that number in isolation?\\nIain Mackay\\nNo, it's not, Michael, but we'll make that determination when the time is right to make that determination. And 2 bad months at the beginning of 2016 aren't really the basis on which we'd make a decision that affects the long-term future of the group.\\nStuart Gulliver\\nI think, Michael, we've had 2 difficult months, January and February; and 2 okay months, March and April. So there's not a trend yet.\\nOperator\\nOur next question today comes from Chris Manners from Morgan Stanley.\\nChris Manners\\nSo 3 questions, if I may. The first one was on Slide 17. Looks actually to be pretty encouraging, the market share gains you're making. Could I ask you maybe to share with us which competitors are you taking share from? You don't have to name them but maybe by type, just give us a sense. And also, now that the volatility has stabilized a little bit after the first 2 months of the year, are the competition regrouping to any degree that you can see? Second question was -- sorry.\\nStuart Gulliver\\nSo we -- yes, carry on.\\nChris Manners\\nSo yes, the second question was just going to be on the Other revenue. That's something I always find it a little bit tricky to forecast. I was just looking at Page -- at Slide 7. It's obviously plus $179 million this quarter. At this time last year, it was minus $200 million. But the last few quarters have been roughly a negative number of $200 million-ish, yet when we think about that line going forward, should that be a sort of plus number, minus number, flat? How should we think about the Other revenue trending? And the last question was just on impairment. I thought it was interesting context you gave us on Slide 18 there of where the impairment charges have been over time. I see you've picked the time period back to 1997, and you've shown us some average impairments in percentages there that seem to be a little bit ahead of where you're running at the moment. Are we -- should we take from that, that you're expecting normalized impairment charges to start creeping up a little bit? Or how should we interpret those?\\nIain Mackay\\nI think, taking the third, first, I wouldn't necessarily interpret anything for it. We provide it as information that, hopefully, is useful to you, to give you some indication that in -- certainly, in absolute terms, on relative terms, the loan impairment charges in the business that matter most to us have seldom risen above a significantly high level.\\nStuart Gulliver\\nAnd the other reason for giving it, Chris, is obviously, fourth quarter -- if you look first quarter of '16, it's much lower than the fourth quarter of '15, but actually much higher than the first quarter. So it's a volatile series. So we wanted to show you what the average was because we thought we'd get a question as to what the average was.\\nIain Mackay\\nYes. In terms of Other revenues, I'll -- Stuart will cover the first one, on competitors.\\nStuart Gulliver\\nYes.\\nIain Mackay\\nBut in terms of Other revenues, I'm not going to try and give you any guidance on the Other. The Other segment, the Other line picks up inter-segment eliminations and consolidation within the group. And it also picks up group elements. And what we had coming through in that particular line in the first quarter was a bit of a hedge ineffectiveness coming through some of the parent company debt that was issued some time ago; and interest rate, whereas interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives that hedge the issuance of that debt. And when you saw some significant movements in both interest rate and foreign exchange in first quarter, then that's really what flowed through in terms of the Other income. So we had a positive effect of about $179 million in the first quarter, and that was largely from hedging effects in this -- on those interest rates and foreign exchange derivatives against holding company debt issued in recent years; and then a negative effect in the first quarter of the preceding year, which was largely in the elimination of inter-segment items. So it is -- it's got some volatility in that line, as you've seen, coming through in recent quarters but, I think a significant amount -- the ability to predict that is largely influenced by the very factors that we saw coming through this quarter in terms of movements in interest rate, foreign exchange and their impact on holding company debt.\\nStuart Gulliver\\nSo looking at competitors\\u2026\\nChris Manners\\nSo we'll be\\u2026\\nStuart Gulliver\\nSorry, carry on.\\nChris Manners\\nYes, I was just going to say so would we be sensible to call that a 0 as we model it going forward just because it's volatile? It doesn't have like an underlying run rate that it should have basically, is that fair to say?\\nIain Mackay\\nNo, there's not an underlying run rate. And it is not an easy item to predict until you start seeing effects coming through: interest rate, foreign exchange and other market movements.\\nStuart Gulliver\\nSo on competitors, it's a bit difficult to sort of indicate who they are without even by giving geographic descriptions without being kind of inappropriate on a call like this. If you think about those banks which have changed strategy and pulled out of Asia, those are the people that we have taken market share from. So the easiest way to do it is by a negative. So the U.S. banks remain highly competitive, but some of the other banks, some other parts of the world have given up on their Asian initiatives.\\nChris Manners\\nOkay. Maybe some U.K. banks?\\nStuart Gulliver\\nPossibly.\\nIain Mackay\\nIt was quite some time ago.\\nStuart Gulliver\\nPossibly. Honestly, Chris, you can kind of work it out, but I think on a call like this, it's not appropriate.\\nChris Manners\\nNo, fair enough.\\nStuart Gulliver\\nOkay, thank you.\\nOperator\\nWe will take our last question today from Stephen Andrews from Deutsche Bank.\\nStephen Andrews\\nJust coming back to the dividend again, just to work out what the actual cash payout ratio is at the moment. I think on Slide 10, you said the dividends, net of scrip, were about $2.1 billion in Q1. And I think you're including some of the pref in that. So am I right in thinking that the underlying payout was about $1.9 billion on the ordinary dividend, so the scrip take-up in the first quarter on the larger, final dividend for last year was probably in the sort of 55%, 60% range? And then the second question is just on the -- your ability to pay the dividend is usually a function of just the cash coming up from different parts of the group. How should we think about -- or how do you think about this slowdown in volumes in Asia? Sitting on the ground in Hong Kong, it feels in some way structural in that you're largely a U.S. dollar lender, a Hong Kong dollar lender, and with the RMB weakening, the demand you had coming from China for U.S. dollar borrowing just isn't there anymore. Whilst that is having an impact on revenues, is this -- should we expect the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp. to be consuming significantly less capital than it was, so be upstreaming more capital going forward than it had done previously?\\nIain Mackay\\nThe scrip take-up on the fourth interim dividend. So we account for dividends on an accounting basis within our capital, so the fourth quarter dividend was accounted for in the capital ratios in the fourth quarter of last year. And the scrip take-up on that was about, just under 10% of the total, which represented about, I think, $440 million, $450 million in terms of cash conservation at the group level. In terms of the upstreaming of dividends...\\nStephen Andrews\\nSorry. I was on -- I meant on Slide 10, the $2.1 billion dividends, net of scrip, which I assume was for the full year dividend.\\nIain Mackay\\nNo, that's an assumption around net of scrip as it relates to the first dividend declared.\\nStuart Gulliver\\nSo that's the first $0.10 of this year.\\nIain Mackay\\nYes, yes. So that relates only to the interim for the first quarter, if you like, or the first interim dividend, to be more precise. In terms of dividend upstreaming from the subsidiaries, we hold the subsidiaries accountable to upstream somewhere between 50% to 70% of their profit attributable after tax. And that is applicable to all the subsidiaries which are in a profit-generating situation. Certainly, as far as Hong Kong goes, like other major subsidiaries in the group, they obviously have to meet local regulatory requirements which the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation does comfortably. And again, the dividend distribution from the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp. is going to follow exactly the same principles as the dividend from ourselves to the ultimate shareholder of the group. It's going to be informed by regulatory capital requirements, the profit-generating capability of the business. And what you can clearly see is a business that continues to be very strongly capital generative.\\nStuart Gulliver\\nThank you very much. Okay, that brings the call to an end. Thank you.\\nIain Mackay\\nThank you.\\nOperator\\nThank you, ladies and gentlemen. That concludes the call for the HSBC Holdings plc's earnings release for first quarter 2016. You may now disconnect.\",\n          \"HSBC Holdings plc, Q1 2024 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2024\\n30/4/24\\nOperator\\nWelcome, ladies and gentlemen, to the analyst and investor webinar on the 2024 first quarter results for HSBC Holdings plc. For your information, this webinar is being recorded. We are now ready to start the webinar, so I will hand over to Mark Tucker, Group Chairman.\\nMark Tucker\\nGood morning to those of you in London, and good afternoon to those of you in Hong Kong. I'm joining you today from London and have alongside me know enjoy. I'll be making some short opening remarks before handing over to Noel.\\nAs you may have already seen, we have announced today that Noel has informed the Board of his intention to retire from the bank after nearly 5 years in the role. The Board and I would like to pay tribute to Noel's exceptional contribution during his time.\\nAs Group Chief Executive, he drags both our transformation strategy as well as creating a simpler, more focused business through the disposal of assets in the U.S., France and Canada. This has enabled us to deliver an improved performance, achieving record profits last year and create a platform for future growth and development.\\nNow, you'll hear from him in a second, has decided it's the right time to step back and find a better balance between his personal and business commitments. As you would expect, the Board keeps succession planning under constant review. We already have started a robust and rigorous process to find our next group Chief Executive.\\nThis process will look at both internal and external candidates. I'm very pleased that now has agreed to remain in his role while this process takes place, ensuring a smooth and orderly transition. And on a personal note, I'd like to thank Noel for his unwavering commitment and dedication to HSBC, which he joined 37 years ago.\\nNow, it's been a pleasure and privilege to work with and alongside you.\\nNoel Quinn\\nThank you, Mark. I'm very grateful for your support, guidance, friendship and partnership. I'm proud of what my HSBC colleagues and I have achieved together over the past 5 years. Over that period, we have hit some significant milestones, record profits last year, the strongest returns in a decade and the highest dividend since 2008.\\nAs Mark mentioned, we have created a more focused business, and I believe we have built a strong platform for the bank's next phase of development and growth. That's why I feel this is the right time to step back to find a better balance between my personal and business commitments with the intention going forward after a break of pursuing a portfolio career.\\nWhen I reflect back on the last 37 years, I have held intensive leadership roles, particularly since I took over the U.K. Commercial Bank in October of 2008. After 16 years of intensive leadership, I'm ready for a change. But it's also a natural inflection point for the bank as it comes to the end of the current transformation phase. It's an ideal time to bring in new leadership.\\nThe Board has now started a process to find my successor, and I'm very happy to continue in my role as that process takes place. Rest assured, I will be working hard to ensure a smooth and orderly transition for my successor and to keep the momentum going in this business, as you have seen in Q1. Until then, it's business as usual.\\nSo, let's now turn to our Q1 results, which have showed continued progress. We had a good first quarter. Reported profit before tax was $12.7 billion. Excluding notable items, profit before tax was $9 billion. Our return on tangible equity was 16.4%, excluding notable items. I'm also pleased with the further capital distributions of $8.8 billion, which brings the total amount of distributed capital by way of dividends and buybacks over the last 15 months to almost $28 billion.\\nAnd we are on track to meet all of our previously communicated guidance for 2024. I will now hand over to Georges to take you through the numbers.\\nGeorges Elhedery\\nThank you, Noel. I'd like to open by paying tribute to the enormous contribution Noel has made to the bank. I've greatly enjoyed working alongside him. And I know everyone at the bank has appreciated this strong and effective leadership. I'm also grateful for the support he has shown me personally since my appointment as CFO, 15 months ago.\\nThe Board has announced the process to find a successor, and I know Non and I will continue to remain very focused on the job at hand until that process has been completed. Turning now to the numbers. Reported profit before tax of $12.7 billion was down $0.3 billion in the first quarter of 2023 on a constant currency basis.\\nExcluding notable items, profit before tax was $9 billion, down $0.4 billion on last year's first quarter. On an annualized basis, we delivered a return on tangible equity of 26.1% or 16.4%, excluding notable items. We completed the $2 billion share buyback announced in February in 2 months. This means that since the end of 2022, we have bought back 6% of our outstanding shares. And the trend of strong shareholder distributions continues this quarter.\\nWe have announced, as Noel said, a further $8.8 billion of distributions consisting of first interim dividend for '24 of $0.10 per share. The special dividend of $0.21 per share from the Canada sale proceeds and a new share buyback of up to $3 billion, which we plan to begin right after the AGM and complete within 3 months.\\nFinally, we are reconfirming all of our 2024 guidance, including a mid-teens return on tangible equity, excluding notable items and our commitment to limit cost growth to around 5% on a target basis.\\nSo, on the next slide, reported profit before tax of $12.7 billion included $4.8 billion gain on the sale of Canada, partly offset by the $1.1 billion impairment on the classification of Argentina as held for sale. Excluding notable items, profit before tax was $9 billion with revenue growth offset primarily by higher costs and ECLs. Revenue of $20.8 billion was up $0.5 billion on the first quarter of last year.\\nExcluding notable items, revenue was $17 billion, which was up $0.5 billion on the first quarter of last year, with growth in banking NII, partly offset by lower fee and other income. Within that, we saw high single-digit growth in multi-jurisdictional revenue in the first quarter, which underlines the value of our global network.\\nBanking NII of $11.3 billion was up $0.6 billion on the fourth quarter on the reported FX basis, mainly driven by Argentina banking NII as well as the nonrecurrence of the cash flow hedge reclassification in the last quarter. Looking ahead to the rest of the year, a few things to keep in mind.\\nFirst, our Q1 banking NII included $0.3 billion from Canada, which will not repeat in future quarters due to the completion of the sale in March this year. Second, first quarter banking NII also included $0.5 billion from Argentina. This contribution will continue to be highly volatile until the sale is completed, which we expect to be within the next 12 months. Please, therefore, do not extrapolate the $0.5 billion run rate for the remainder of the year.\\nOur banking NII guidance assumes a contribution of around $1 billion in full year '24 for Argentina, which is in line with full year 2023. Third, the banking NII outlook has improved in several respects since we announced our full year results in February. The Hong Kong time deposit mix remained stable as a percentage of customer deposits in the quarter and markets are now pricing in more modest cuts to interest rates.\\nHowever, it is still early in the year, and these things can change. So, we are maintaining our 2024 banking NII guidance of at least $41 billion. Turning to fee and other income. Wholesale transaction banking was down by 9%, primarily due to the normalization of FX revenues compared to a very strong foreign exchange performance in the first quarter of last year, which benefited from higher market volatility.\\nFees from Global Payment Solutions had another good quarter, up by 6%. Wealth is another growth area that had a very good quarter, up by 14% on the same period last year as our investment continued to drive improved results. Private Banking was a standout performer, mainly driven by increased customer activity in brokerage and trading in Asia, but growth in wealth has been broad-based.\\nTo illustrate this, we acquired around 135,000 new-to-bank retail wealth customers in Hong Kong in the quarter. Approximately 60% of these were nonresidents attracted by our service and product capabilities in Hong Kong.\\nBuilding on previous quarters, we attracted $27 billion of net new invested assets, of which $19 billion were in Asia. And our insurance new business CSM was $0.8 billion, up from $0.4 billion in the first quarter of last year.\\nOn credit, expected credit losses were $0.7 billion in the quarter, equivalent to 30 basis points of average loans. These were primarily Stage 3 charges across retail and wholesale. There was a $54 million charge related to our Mainland China commercial real estate portfolio.\\nWhile challenges remain within the sector, we expect a more benign ECL contribution from it than last year. We remain comfortable with our current level of provisions and continue monitoring developments closely. And we are reconfirming our 2024 ECL guidance of around 40 basis points of average loans, recognizing the overall uncertainty from the flow-through effect of higher rates on the economy.\\nNext, we are on track to meet our target of limiting 2024 cost growth to around 5% on a target basis. This quarter's year-on-year cost growth was impacted by 3 items. First, we chose to face the accrual of our performance-related pay more evenly this year than we did last year. This accounted for 2 percentage points of cost growth this quarter. We do not currently expect the total amount of performance-related pay for 2024 to be significantly different to 2023. So, the accrual will be lower over the next 3 quarters than it was in the same period last year.\\nSecond, HSBC Innovation Banking contributed to 1 percentage point of cost growth this quarter as we only acquired SBB U.K. in the middle of March last year. We intend to provide you with a fuller update on that business at the half year, but I'm pleased that it has good momentum. In the U.K., we onboarded 183 new-to-bank innovation banking client groups in the quarter, the best quarter since acquisition.\\nFinally, another percentage point of the cost growth in the quarter was due to the Bank Finland levy and the incremental FDIC special assessment. We remain committed to cost discipline, and we are reconfirming our guidance of limiting 2024 cost growth to circa 5% on a target basis, inclusive of all the above items.\\nOn lending and deposits. There was good loan growth in the U.K., the Middle East, Mexico and Asia, excluding Hong Kong. Loan demand in Hong Kong remains subdued, largely due to the high interest rate differential with Mainland China.\\nOverall, we continue to expect mid-single-digit loan growth over the medium to long term, but we expect demand to remain subdued in the near term. Deposits were down 2%. This was due to a range of factors, including seasonality, the switch from time deposits to wealth products in Hong Kong and our deliberate choice to forsake some highly price-sensitive deposits.\\nNext, our CET 1 ratio was 15.2%, up 40 basis points on the fourth quarter. Organic capital generation and the gain from the sale of the Canadian business enabled us to announce $8.8 billion of capital distributions this quarter. This includes a share buyback of up to $3 billion, which is expected to have an impact of around 40 basis points on our CET1 ratio in the second quarter.\\nFor modeling purposes, please note that the $5.8 billion of dividends announced today as well as the $5.9 billion in respect of the ordinary dividend announced at the full year results in February will both be reflected in TNAV in the second quarter. At closing of the sale of HSBC Argentina, which is expected within 12 months, we will also recognize $4.9 billion of foreign exchange reserve recycling losses subject to any movement in this reserve up until completion.\\nThese losses have already been accumulated in capital over the previous years. Therefore, recognition in the P&L will have no impact on CET1 nor on TNAV. Finally, looking forward to the rest of the year, our good first quarter puts us on track and we are reconfirming all of our 2024 guidance.\\nA mid-teens return on tangible equity, excluding notable items, a banking NII of at least $41 billion, ECLs of around 40 basis points cost growth limited to around 5% on a target basis and a 50% dividend payout ratio.\\nAnd with that, Louis, can we please go to Q&A.\\nOperator\\n[Operator instructions] Our first question today comes from Joseph Dickerson at Jefferies.\\nJoseph Dickerson\\nCongrats, Noel on a great tenure at the bank and well done for the ROE and the capital return. I guess, just in terms of my question, the PD migration in Hong Kong, if you go back to the way you were computing it previously actually looks like it improved quarter-on-quarter and certainly under the new definition, has stabilized.\\nI think it's Slide 17, if I'm not mistaken, in the presentation. Is that a little bit better than where your expectations were a few months ago? I know when I was in Hong Kong recently, it sounded like things were starting to stabilize, but is that better than where you were thinking a few months ago?\\nAnd then secondly, on the buybacks, is the $3 billion number due more to the calendar effect? Or are you looking to kind of boost the run rate there from the $2 billion in the quarter?\\nGeorges Elhedery\\nThank you, Joseph. So, first, on the time deposit reclassification, we have actually reclassified some private bank term deposits to time deposits. This is due to the observation of their behavior and the recognition that they better classify this time deposits. This rebases the number. But as you could see from the 2 choices we have, it does not affect the trend.\\nSo, therefore, the trend that we've seen under both classifications is the same, and we've seen the first quarter stable quarter-on-quarter. It's too early to call it a peak, but we've always expected migration this year to be slower than what we've seen last year. And this just confirms the trend change from what we've seen in full year 2023.\\nAs regards to your buyback question, so the short answer is, yes, this is indeed due to calendar effects. We just completed a EUR 2 billion buyback in 2 months. That's about $1 billion a month. That is the fastest run rate we've done in terms of share buybacks ever.\\nWe are now announcing a EUR 3 billion buyback, which we intend to do over the next 3 months, starting after AGM. We will see how the run rate goes, it will remain at the $1 billion run rate. We will see how it will go.\\nAs regards any future amount of buyback or whether we're doing a buyback, one, it remains our intention to return excess capital to our shareholders through a rolling series of share buyback.\\nAnd, second, we will decide on a quarter-by-quarter basis based on our capital outlook, the loan growth outlook and other parameters as and when every quarter.\\nOperator\\n[Operator instructions] Our next question today comes from Raul Sinha at JPMorgan.\\nRaul Sinha\\nMaybe 2 from me as well. Just doing, George, on this point on distribution and looking at the sort of moving parts for capital, one of the interesting things in this quarter was the move up in RWAs. I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more color on the growth in RWAs. The EUR 7 billion of increase driven by asset quality trends. I think you're calling out is predominantly in Asia.\\nWhat should we think about the sort of outlook for RWA growth from here even if loan build is muted, just to get a sense of the amount of capital that you will have in content terms for distributions?\\nAnd I guess the second question to Noel, just maybe a question for your broader thoughts, no. The 5 years proceeding have been pretty extraordinary, not just for HSBC, but I guess, for a lot of people given in your markets given the pandemic. But when we look at where HSBC is now, you exited Canada, you announced Argentina. You're in the process of exiting quite a few smaller markets.\\nReturn on tangible equity is already in the mid-teens. You're buying back stock at $3 billion a quarter, you've got a special dividend as well. I guess what I'm really interested in is from here onwards, what do you think is left to do for the group to kind of progress?\\nGeorges Elhedery\\nThank you, Raul. I'll start with your first question first. So, on RWA outlook. So the RWA growth, we called on a quarter-on-quarter basis, $24 billion. First, about 40% of it related to lending and other asset growth. And as you can see from our lending book, we've grown our lending book by EUR 5 billion. There's a number of areas of growth that contributed to around 40% of it, $9 billion.\\nThen we've had a $5 billion market tristRWA growth. This is due to a pickup in NSS activity against a subdued 4Q, and it's more in line with their activity levels in the first 3 quarters of the year, if you want. And this is the normalization of the market's activity.\\nAnd then there is $7 billion, which we classified broadly as asset quality. Now, asset quality, first, it is a continuous exercise. We do this portfolio monitoring review on a regular basis. We have recognized across a number of geographies and a number of sectors, certain names, which we've decided to downgrade on the basis that the interest rate pressure on their cash flows has been more severe.\\nYou will not see an equivalent of that downgrade in ECL. And that's mainly because for many of these customers, their balance sheet remains strong. So, we're comfortable with their balance sheet and therefore, there is no ECL implication from this downgrade. But just closing the loop, this RWA downgrade, you will see some of it materialize in our Stage 3 loans, where we increased our Stage 3 loans by about $2 billion, and that's exactly the mapping of some of this asset quality.\\nWith regards to how we look forward, we are very comfortable where we are today. Our credit metrics remain solid. As I say, the balance sheet of our customers remains strong for a number of them for at least the exposure that is collateralized. We're very comfortable with the level of collateralization and the LTV. And therefore, we do not foresee at this stage today any additional action we should be taking.\\nWe will obviously monitor the book on a regular basis as we always do. Noel?\\nNoel Quinn\\nThank you. It has certainly been an extraordinary 5 years, I should say, not just for HSBC, but for the world. And I'm really pleased and grateful I want to pay tribute to the team for the way they've collectively navigated that. And during that whole process, the external environment executed on a complex but absolutely critical transformation plan over the past 5 years.\\nAnd the outcome of that hard work is evident in the financial performance last year and the financial performance in Q1. I also want to say thanks to Mark, with such volatility in an external environment. Any CEO needs the support of their chair, their advice, their guidance, and I've had that all the way through and have had the support from the Board all the way through in navigating what has been a very complex external environment.\\nBut the team, the Board, Mark, collectively, we've done a good job of navigating it. Now, if I look forward, I'm not going to give to do list to my successor because that is not the fair thing to do to anyone. But I will give you some thoughts about what we as a team are very much focused on. And I'm focused on for as long as I'm still CEO, and that is continuing the momentum.\\nYou don't work as hard as we worked for the past 5 years and then take the eye off the ball at this moment in time. So, I'm very focused on a smooth, orderly transition. I'm very focused on continued execution of the strategy. I want to clarify our thinking on one element of the strategy. We have exited a lot of businesses, a lot of RWAs over the past 5 years.\\nThe one thing we've protected whilst doing that is the international core of HSBC. The countries we remain in, the businesses we remain in are fundamentally now focused on the international nature and essence of HSBC, and we will continue to do that.\\nOur key requirement is to continue to deliver good returns that are sustainable and repeatable whilst also taking advantage of the growth opportunities as they emerge in a world that becomes more stable and there are inherent in our customer franchise.\\nTherefore, we're very focused on continuing the development of wealth, our transaction banking capabilities, our global wholesale banking capabilities and then being ready for when corporate loan demand picks up, we can take advantage of that to couple good returns with sustainable growth.\\nAnd I think you've seen evidence of that in these results. Hong Kong is subdued at the moment, but we understand why with the rate differential in China. But if you look at the rest of the world, as George said, there's balance sheet growth in Wholesale Banking, in the rest of Asia, in the Middle East, in U.K., in Europe. We're seeing good growth elsewhere.\\nSo, it's about focus, momentum, continuing to couple good returns with good growth.\\nOperator\\n[Operator instructions] Our next question today comes from Jeremy Hugh at CICC.\\nJeremy Hugh\\nSo, the first question is on deposits. We're glad to see that cat migration in Hong Kong is slowing down, but if not stabilized at this level. But on the other hand, I think the bank has seen some deposit outflow in Q1, while your Hong Kong local peers still see some deposit growth. So, I'm wondering if there is a strategic trade-off between the deposit growth and the cost for you at this stage? And how do you see that trend in the rest of the year?\\nThe second question is on the structural hedge. So, I'm wondering if this quarter, you could share with us some breakdown of our structural hedge and how much did we benefit from the reinvestment of the structural hedge? And if there is any run rate that we can refer to?\\nGeorges Elhedery\\nThank you, Jeremy. So, on your first question about deposits in Hong Kong. So, if you remember at Q4, our deposits in Hong Kong have increased by about $14 billion. What we've seen in Q1 this year is a decrease of about $16 billion. Therefore, you can see seasonality playing across the 2 quarters, and therefore, is broadly stable across the 2 quarters.\\nWhat happened though is, some of these deposit inflows in Q4 related to some deposit campaigns we were driving to drive some of our deposits into wealth. And when you look at Q1, while you see the deposit outflows, you also can see that $19 billion of our net new invested assets were in Asia.\\nTherefore, a chunk of these outflows has manifested or translated into wealth inflows for us, which was the purpose of the campaign in Q4 and explains if you want the seasonality of this deposit.\\nSecond, look, we have a powerful deposit franchise. We have a very cherished and viable franchise. We continue globally being a very attractive deposit proposition for both our retail and wholesale customers. We cherish this. We continue investing in our deposit capabilities. And throughout the last 6 quarters, you've seen how our deposit base has been very stable with our deposit costs being relatively benign compared to some of our peers. Therefore, I won't comment on month-to-month movements between ourselves and our peers.\\nIf I move on to your second question about the structural hedge. So, first, you would have noticed that we increased this quarter, the structural hedge by about $10 billion, taking it to $487 million, with the average weighted average life broadly unchanged at just shy of 3 years.\\nSecond, we commit at this stage to continue our structural hedging activity. Obviously, this will remain subject to market conditions, but we will continue the trend that we put in Q1 based on current market outlook. This activity of additional structural hedging will contribute to a mild headwind toward banking NII. And this is due to the fact that the rate curves are inverted as you know, and you can do the math.\\nBut equally, we also are reinvesting maturing structural hedges at higher rates. And this reinvestment of maturing of structural hedges at higher rates is a tailwind into banking NII. Between the 2 of those effects, the structural hedge activity for the full year 2024 would remain a net tailwind to our banking NII. We have not yet quantified to the market that tailwind.\\nWe're looking at enhancing our disclosure in this space. But that tailwind has been factored into our guidance of at least $41 billion bank NII and obviously, factored into our return on tangible equity mid-teens guidance.\\nOperator\\nThe next question today comes from Jason Napier at UBS.\\nJason Napier\\nFirst of all, just to echo the best wishes, Noel, for the next chapter of your career and private life, I think, a well-earned rebalancing.\\nGeorge, I just wondered whether you talk a little bit within the context of higher for longer, you've referenced subdued loan demand in Hong Kong due to the differentials in interest rates. And I just wonder whether one of your peers has spoken at some length about looking forward to a change in asset mix as loan demand comes back as a way to defend margins and revenue.\\nSo, I wonder whether you might talk a little bit about whether that's a material part of the plan? And sort of what do you think that means for revenue sort of evolution in the next few quarters? I think I certainly was somewhat surprised that we didn't see an upgrade to banking NII guidance this quarter. I know you don't rebalance every quarter, but I just wonder whether you might talk to the role that Higher for longer has on asset mix and then on credit demand.\\nAnd then secondly, wealth was phenomenal in Q1. I know there's a part of the business that's quite closely linked to what goes on with the Hang Seng Index, which is now 20% in in a short space of time. But I just wonder whether you could talk to the sustainability of those run rates. Is that the strategy delivering the sort of net new money flows? Or is there an element of sort of market volume there that we should be a little bit careful about?\\nGeorges Elhedery\\nThank you, Jason. So, first on Banking NII, we recognize there are kind of a couple of encouraging developments. The first one is the higher for longer on the rate side that would look like more favorable than when we discussed last in February. And, the second one we just touched on, which is the balance sheet mix, specifically in Hong Kong, where we've seen term deposits remain stable for this quarter.\\nSo, we recognize these tailwinds to our banking NII, but we also recognize quite early in the year, and these factors can still change. So this is why we didn't change our guidance. And as you said, Jason, I don't think you should expect us to update our guidance every quarter. We would reconsider this every quarter. But for this quarter, we're just sticking with our at least $41 billion.\\nIn terms of the wealth performance, so recognize mid-teens percentage growth in wealth, 34% for our private bank. I would say a couple of things. The first one is, yes, this is an area that we've already said it's a focused strategic area. We are investing in this area. Big part of our investments goes towards this area, and we're very pleased to see the results of our investments generate revenue fairly quickly.\\nYou can see that through net new invested assets growth. You can see that through our CSM, new business CSM growth in insurance as well as in the actual revenue performance. This being said, I would just caution you not to annualize the numbers you're seeing because Q1 2023 had somewhat subdued January in it when China and Hong Kong were still closed.\\nSo, therefore, you've seen more pickup in activity in the Q1 '23 at the back end of it, whereas we had a full proper Q1 '24. So, there is an element of not annualizing the performance, but expecting that performance to continue growing.\\nI just realized I didn't touch on your asset mix question of the first question. Look, we do not foresee a material change in our asset mix. We had seen for the last few quarters of last year, the main growth take place in mortgages and recognizing mortgages have seen very competitive levels both in the U.K. and Hong Kong, and the margins have been quite tight.\\nAs we start seeing pickup in wholesale demand, as we start peeing pickup in unsecured lending, we are more hopeful that those will drive higher margins than if you want what we see in mortgages. And our numbers in Q1 did show that this pickup definitely is there in areas of Asia, Southeast Asia, India, the Middle East, the U.K., et cetera. And the next in line for that pickup will be Hong Kong, which we expect at some stage later in the year as we see dollar rates ease.\\nOperator\\n[Operator instructions] Our next question comes from Perlie Mong from KBW.\\nPerlie Mong\\nCan I just dig a little bit further into Jason's question just now on higher for longer. So, I know you probably don't like to comment on longer-term NII. But I guess in a higher for longer rate environment, which is how are you thinking about the trajectory going from here because it sounds to me that deposit migration is probably, well, stabilized a lot.\\nAnd I would have thought any longer pricing that hasn't already come through will come through in the next few months. And I guess in a higher for longer rate environment, you can probably build more hedges at better rates as well, et cetera. And there's obviously a tailwind as you mentioned in this year already. So, how does that inform your thinking on your medium-term RoTE? So I guess that's the first question.\\nAnd the second question, again, on broader activity level, maybe not just on credit. So, again, I guess just noting your point that Hong Kong might be a mix in line to pick up. But I guess, overall, the emerging market is probably not benefiting in terms of activity level and in terms of capital inflows from the higher U.S. rates.\\nSo, how does that impact, I guess, trading activities and capital flows, et cetera, just how are you thinking about the flip side of hirer longer?\\nGeorges Elhedery\\nThank you, Perlie. So first, look, yes, we recognize higher for longer is definitely a tailwind or a reduction of a headwind we've forecast in our banking NII. And as I said, there has been a number of manifestation of tailwinds now compared to when we last spoke in February.\\nBut equally, it is early in the year. And as you've seen, these things do change. And we now, therefore, want to bake in some sense of uncertainty due to the changing parameters. We will update some longer than what we're updating but not at this quarter, barely. So, do expect us coming in the future quarters and give you further outlook for the future.\\nI would say the one parameter, just to keep in mind, as you start planning for '25 is take Argentina out because, obviously, subject to the sale completing, which we expect to complete in the next 12 months, that potential $1 billion contribution from Argentina will go away from our banking NII. That's the most kind of predictable parameter where we stand today as you look into 2025.\\nIn terms of the broader activity level, first, if you look at the wealth performance, it just demonstrates how wealth remains very resilient. And that's particularly true in Hong Kong, but very much so across Asia. Second, when you look at our transaction banking activities, apart from foreign exchange, which has an idiosyncrasy related to Q1 '23 with a very high volatility has performed across the various areas of its fee earning activities.\\nAnd then our activity is very much benefiting from cross-border trends. If you look at some of the investments or foreign direct investments or trade flows taking place intra region in Asia between China and ASEAN between India and ASEAN, between India and the west, et cetera, all of those trends are growing. I mean the numbers are staggering in some cases. And these are the activities that our business is operating on.\\nSo, therefore, while recognizing that there will be some interest rate challenges for borrowers at these levels, there is still a very strong underlying network activity, which is benefiting our overall businesses, particularly in wholesale transaction banking, anyway.\\nPerlie Mong\\nOn that, it's just I've also noticed that China exports volumes have been going up, but value has been coming down. And that is in part because of various things. FX is be part of it but also government subsidies. How does that affect your, I guess, your profitability in the region, volumes going up, the value is going down?\\nGeorges Elhedery\\nPerlie, if I can just give you an indication. What we are seeing at the moment is a very strong level of activity of China corporates expanding across the rest of Asia.\\nSo, our outbound activity from Mainland China to the rest of the world is seeing a significant increase in activity over the past 12 months. We've seen that trend continue in the first quarter of this year. So, a lot of people talk about inward investment into China slowing down. But what I would say is outward investment from China to the rest of the world is actually picking up at quite a pace a very significant pace.\\nWe're very well placed to capture that outflow, and we are capturing that outflow. And our business in Mainland China performed well last year. It's performing well again in the first quarter of this year and its outbound activity is performing extremely well. So, we'll give more updates on that at the half year, but we are capturing that. And that is why actually I think the rest of Asia is performing well on balance sheet because a lot of it is being fed by good intra-Asia activity and outbound from Mainland China.\\nOperator\\nNext question today comes from Katherine Lei at JPMorgan.\\nKatherine Lei\\nI have 3 questions, 3 small questions, actually. The first one is on noninterest income. I look at the breakdown of noninterest income. It seems like wealth is doing quite well. But on Transaction Banking, there is some weakness, I think it's down 9% Y-o-Y. Can we know what is the reason? And how should we triangulate this to the full year? What are the drivers to that? So this is the first one.\\nThe second one is on Hong Kong. With Hong Kong relaxing LTV ratios, I think basically, not only they would be they relax the purchase requirements and the stability requirements on residential properties. So, I think that there is a significant jump in transaction. So, I was thinking that this should be positive to mortgage at least, and then we are a big mortgage providers in Hong Kong.\\nSo, will that have any impact on our outlook in terms of growth, particularly related to Hong Kong? Second one. And then the last one, I think, is on cost. If I look at the first quarter, I think cost is up 8%, including levy. How should I look at this? And then are we on track to the 5% cost growth this year?\\nGeorges Elhedery\\nThank you, Katherine. I'll take question 1 and 3, and I'll hand over to Noel to address your second question about the outlook for Hong Kong. So, first on non-NII.\\nWealth has performed well. Transaction banking weakness is specifically due to foreign exchange. That's driving the whole weakness. And the reason, as I called it out earlier, the reason is that foreign exchange had a record strong quarter 1 '23 on the back of heightened market anxiety and volatility back then due to the banking crisis.\\nSo, therefore, we're doing a comparison to a record quarter, and it will show that drop. But if you look at the number itself, and the revenue itself for foreign exchange, it is back to normalized levels. So, there is nothing to worry about here. It's on the contrary back to normalized levels, and we continue to expect some cyclicality in that space, while we continue expecting growth in the other areas of transaction banking.\\nSo, I wouldn't read more than that into it, and we remain very confident that the investment we're putting both in wealth and transaction banking and in the technology supporting our transaction banking activities do remain strategic focus and bearing results as we look into future quarters and years.\\nOn your third question about cost. So, first, I just want to reiterate, it is a clear priority for us to maintain cost discipline, okay? And we are very confident we will limit cost growth to circa 5%. We will limit cost growth to circa 5% on a target basis.\\nWe're confident about it. And we're actually on track to do so. And the reason why we're kind of on track to do so yet, we showed a 7% quarter 1 growth on a target basis is because of a few idiosyncratic items related to the quarter, which are not repeated in future quarters or some of them will reverse in future quarters. I'll just call the 3 of them out that matter.\\nFirst, there was a 2% accrual of the performance-related pay where we decided to phase that accrual more evenly throughout the year than we did last year. This will manifest in a higher performance-related pay accrual in Q1, hence, the 2% contribution towards the 7%, but it will contribute to lower accrual in future quarters because on a full year basis, we are not accruing to a significantly different number than the full year '23 performance-related pay.\\nSecond, there was 1% contribution from HSBC Innovation Banking this quarter because last year's first quarter, we only acquired SBB in the middle of March, which means we practically didn't have it in the first quarter last year, and that's a base effect.\\nAnd then third, we had the one-offs or the expected nonrecurrence of the FDIC special assessment additional charge this quarter as well as the bank of in levy. Bank of Finland levy is a new charge, which used to be an interest expense as an NII and now it's moved to operations expense as in cost. And between the 2 of them, they contributed to 1%.\\nSo, if you adjust for those and you bake them in, we're still and remain confident to meet our 5% cost target on a full year or circa 5% on a full year basis. On your second question, I'll hand over to Noel.\\nNoel Quinn\\nKatherine, I was in Hong Kong recently and spoke to a number of the market participants there and the developers. And I think firstly, I think the change to the stamp duty arrangements in Hong Kong in March in the budget was very well received, and it's had a positive impact on the activity levels of sales in the Hong Kong market residential sales. It was an extremely significant inflow of activity in the first month. That will be very beneficial to the liquidity positions of many of those developers.\\nWe have to wait and see how that stabilizes because undoubtedly, there was an element of catch up in that first month because people were anticipating some change. Therefore, there was low activity in the preceding months. And then we got to see how that stabilizes. But I think that is a very positive move. It will enhance liquidity within the market. It will enhance activity in the mortgage market. But I think it's too early to call a trend at the moment. I think we need to see how Q2 stabilizes following those changes, but a very helpful intervention.\\nOperator\\nCoombs\\\" type=\\\"A\\\"\\nGeorges Elhedery\\nThank you, Andrew. So the UK NIM was up 6 basis points, indeed, essentially benefited from some idiosyncrasies of structural hedges and timing of structural hedge maturities and reinvestments.\\nSo, if you consider broadly flat to be broadly a range of plus or minus 10 basis points. I would say U.K. NIM has been broadly flat for the last couple of quarters. And we foresee it to remain broadly flat in the next quarter. And you will, therefore, add to that broadly flat, some structural hedge due increases, which will drive you within this plus or minus 10 basis point range.\\nAs regards our loans and deposits have been stable. Again, the U.K. economy has been resilient, we're very optimistic about the outlook for the U.K., specifically around inflation and employment. It remains a very important customer franchise for us. It remains a very important market for us, and we continue gaining market share.\\nI mean, we continue gaining market share in mortgages with a 10% new business market share when our back book now market share has moved or our kind of overall portfolio market shares moved from 7% to 8%. We are a 25% market share in SME lending.\\nAnd obviously, we continue investing in this business. You can look at the ring-fenced bank cost growth and how much we can support cost and investment growth for their infants bank within our overall circa 5% cost growth.\\nSo, all this demonstrates the confidence we have in our business in the U.K., our client activity in the U.K. and the outlook for the U.K. If I move to Argentina, I wish I could give you a trend for Argentina, then the way it works is the numbers balloon with hyperinflation, and then they kind of they shrink with devaluation, and it depends how they manifest themselves over month-over-month.\\nQ4 last year has seen hyperinflation to some level, but they have seen a massive devaluation. If you recall, in December, we've seen more than 50% currency devaluation. That's contributed to a disinflation of the amount that Banking Argentina brought to Q4. And then this quarter is exactly the opposite. We've seen 6% devaluation only, but we've seen 54% inflation, and that will just inflate the numbers.\\nSo, it will be volatile quarter-on-quarter. And our best estimate for the full year is that it may average out to what it averaged out over the last year, which is around EUR 1 billion. Now just looking at the overall Argentina, if you take in the nonbanking NII, you take in the cost base, et cetera, last year's Argentina contribution to our PBT was $0.2 billion. Just to put it in perspective, this is about $0.01 earnings per share or 0.5% dividend per share.\\nTherefore, I think as you look at the full year '24, that's the quantum that Argentina volatility will create. So, it should not distract you from the way you're forecasting the bank's outcomes.\\nAndrew Coombs\\nI guess just to follow up on this. In a scenario whereby you didn't have any devaluation of peso. Inflation was a more moderate normal amount? And what would the NII contribution be under that more kind of BAU scenario a quarter for Argentina?\\nGeorges Elhedery\\nLook, again, it's a difficult one to say. But if you just do the arithmetic of our EUR 1 billion expected for the full year, of which already EUR 0.5 billion has manifested in the first quarter. A smooth out outcome would be the other $0.5 billion phased out evenly over 3 quarters. But that's a highly volatile number. So, I wouldn't use it as a \\u2013 as I said a forecast.\\nOperator\\nThank you, ladies and gentlemen. That ends today's webinar.

I'm joined here in London by Pam. Before Pam takes you through the numbers, I would like to begin with some opening remarks. Overall, there was a strong quarter marked by three key drivers: momentum in our earnings, discipline in our execution, and confidence in our ability to deliver our targets.\\nFirst, we have strong momentum in our business. We had a strong first quarter with profit before tax up 11% and an annualized return on tangible equity of 18.4%, both excluding notable items.\\nWe had our fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in Wealth and attracted net new invested assets of $22 billion as well as another 300,000 new-to-bank customers in Hong Kong, continuing the trend from last year. We also had a strong performance in Transaction Banking, in particular, in FX. And our equities and debt trading businesses, benefiting from higher client activity on the back of higher volatility.\\nSecond, we remain focused on executing our strategy with discipline and are on track to deliver the cost actions we set out in February. We are progressing at pace to deliver on the simplification-related cost saves as well as the strategic cost reallocations. We also continue to take a disciplined approach to our investments and capital allocation to drive growth across our four businesses. We will provide you with a full update on this at the half year results in July.\\nThird, the external macroeconomic environment is less favorable and more uncertain than it was in February as the uncertainty around trade policy dampens business confidence and constrains investment. However, we remain confident in our ability to deliver our targets. Our balance sheet is strong. This is reflected in the deposit surpluses we hold in every major currency in each of our four businesses in every geography in which we operate.\\nThis is why our clients place their trust in us during times of predictability and even more so during times of unpredictability. These provide us with a steady recurring income stream and underpin the lion's share of our banking NII.\\nGrowing our structural hedge has reduced the sensitivity of these revenues to interest rate cuts. Our balance sheet is also underpinned by a strong capital position and a high-quality credit portfolio. We also have resilient recurring fee income from stable floor-based activities in transaction banking and in wealth, with a much smaller contribution from investment banking event-driven business. I encourage you to keep the diversity and quality of our earnings in mind when considering how changes in trade policy will affect our business.\\nOur wholesale transaction banking business covers much broader activities than those related to cross-border trade. And within our trade finance business, we have diverse products, and cover all major global and intra-regional corridors. To assess the impact, higher tariffs could have on our business, We modeled scenarios that contemplate significant but plausible increases in tariffs by the world's largest trading blocks, resulting in a notable slowdown in global trade as well as a slowdown in global GDP growth. In a plausible downside tariff scenario, we estimate that there would be a low single-digit percentage impact on the group's revenues.\\nSeparately, our consensus downside scenario models a slowdown in global trade and GDP growth as a result of an increase in tariffs. The impact of this scenario would be incremental ECLs of $0.5 billion. On this basis, we remain confident in delivering a mid-teens return on tangible equity for 2025, 2026 and 2027 and are reaffirming all of the guidance that we gave in February. We recognize, though, that the broader impacts of the current conditions are more difficult to quantify, and we will continue to monitor these as we formulate our ongoing outlook. Importantly, in the current environment, customers look for the strength, stability and expertise of a trusted partner.\\nWe are extremely well positioned to support all of our customers wherever they are; however, they need to evolve and whatever the market conditions. Finally, we're also pleased to announce an up to $3 billion share buyback and a $0.10 per share interim dividend, reflecting our continued focus on capital return to our investors.\\nWith that, let me hand over to Pam.\",\n","  'topics': ['Earnings Growth',\n","   'Strategic Execution',\n","   'Macroeconomic Uncertainty'],\n","  'key_insights': ['Earnings growth is strong with a 11% increase in profit before tax and 18.4% return on tangible equity.',\n","   'Execution of strategy is disciplined, with progress on cost actions and capital allocation.',\n","   'Macroeconomic uncertainty due to trade policy could impact business confidence and investment.'],\n","  'sentiment': {'label': 'neutral', 'confidence': 0.8},\n","  'risk_flags': [{'name': 'Macroeconomic Uncertainty',\n","    'severity': 'medium',\n","    'detail': 'Trade policy uncertainty may dampen business confidence and investment.'}],\n","  'kpis': [{'name': 'Profit Before Tax', 'value': 'Up 11%'},\n","   {'name': 'Return on Tangible Equity', 'value': '18.4%'},\n","   {'name': 'Share Buyback', 'value': 'Up to $3 billion'},\n","   {'name': 'Interim Dividend', 'value': '$0.10 per share'}],\n","  'review_required': False,\n","  'analysis_model': 'phi-4-mini-instruct',\n","  'analysis_latency_s': 11.561},\n"," {'type': 'answer',\n","  'person_type': 'presenter',\n","  'name': 'Manveen Kaur',\n","  'text': \"Thank you, Georges. Thank you, everyone, for joining. The momentum in our business has enabled us to deliver a strong first quarter performance headlined by an annualized return on tangible equity of 18.4%, excluding notable items. We had very good underlying profit and revenue performances.\\nCredit remained stable, and we maintained a disciplined approach to cost management. We are pleased to announce a first interim dividend of $0.10 per share and a share buyback of up to $3 billion. The buybacks we completed over the last 12 months have helped take us closer to our target range of 14% to 14.5% CET1. We will continue to return surplus capital to shareholders with buybacks remaining our preferred method. As always, a decision on any share buyback will be made on a quarterly basis. It will depend on organic capital generation and the capital needs of the business.\\nUnpacking the revenue story, excluding notable items, revenue of $17.7 billion was up $1.1 billion on the first quarter of last year, driven by fee and other income. It also included a $0.3 billion increase in debt and equity markets driven by higher volatility and a favorable impact of $0.2 billion in the quarter from the disposal of Argentina, which we completed at the end of last year.\\nOn banking NII, excluding the impact of Argentina, and other notable items, the banking NII run rate remained broadly stable for the -- on the fourth quarter. The impact of interest rate cuts and to fewer days in the quarter were offset by the repricing of liabilities and structural hedge assets and some favorable changes in asset mix.\\nWe continue to expect banking NII of around $42 billion in 2025. As previously stated, this is not an underpin. It remains our expectation at the present time, based on the current market rates outlook and our own projections.\\nMoving to fee and other income. Wholesale transaction banking was up 13% on last year's first quarter. This was driven by a strong FX performance as elevated volatility drove substantial volumes of client hedging activity. Excluding the impact of disposals, Global Payment Solutions was up 3% year-on-year, and Global Trade Solutions was up 6%. In Wealth, the strong momentum from the fourth quarter continued, as we delivered our fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit year-on-year growth.\\nHigh client activity levels in Asia, primarily Hong Kong were the key driver, and there was broad-based growth. We are pleased that the investment we are making in our Wealth products, distribution channels and customer journeys is translating into results. A record new business CSM 301,000 new-to-bank customers in Hong Kong and $22 billion of net new invested assets, $16 billion of which was in Asia. The CSM balance, which is a store of future value was up again this quarter. As you know, the CSM balance is subject to market fluctuations and sensitivities to key indices are in the earning release.\\nOn credit, our first quarter ECL charge of $0.9 billion equivalent to an annualized charge of 37 basis points as a percentage of loans and advances. This included a $150 million provision to reflect heightened economic uncertainty. Excluding this, the first quarter charge was broadly the same as in the first quarter of 2024. The credit risk metrics that we track remains stable, and we continue to monitor them closely. Thinking about the potential impact of tariffs on credit performance, ECLs will be sensitive to macroeconomic performance, the outlook for which remains uncertain. We consider a variety of scenarios as part of our ECL calculation.\\nOne of these is the consensus downside scenario, in which an increase in tariffs results in a global economic slowdown. In this scenario, there would be an incremental ECL charge of around $0.5 billion.\\nOn costs, we are taking a disciplined approach to cost management and are on target to achieve our target of around 3% cost growth in 2025, compared to 2024 on a target basis. We are also on track to deliver $0.3 billion of simplification savings into the P&L in 2025.\\nOn loans and deposits, loan balances were broadly stable quarter-on-quarter, as growth in Corporate and Institutional Banking was offset by the reclassification of our retained French home loan portfolio.\\nDeposits were also broadly stable quarter-on-quarter with a partial reversal of some of the seasonal inflows we saw in Q4. Year-on-year, deposits were up 6% with growth in all entities and businesses. Our CET1 ratio was 14.7%. The reclassification of our retained French home loan portfolio led to a $1.3 billion pretax loss in the quarter, recognized in fair value through other comprehensive income. This had a capital impact of around 0.2 percentage points of CET1.\\nLooking ahead, we expect the buyback we announced today to have an impact of around 0.4 percentage points in the second quarter. You will have seen that BoCom has announced that it has approved a share issuance of up to RMB 120 billion. Upon completion, we expect to recognize an accounting impact dilution loss of between $1.2 billion and $1.6 billion on our stake. This will be treated as a material notable item and will have no material impact on CET1 and no impact on the dividend.\\nLet me end by summarizing. First, we have momentum in our earnings. We had a strong first quarter performance with an annualized return on tangible equity of 18.4%, excluding notable items. We have also continued to perform well in the quarter to date.\\nSecond, we have discipline in our execution. We are on track to deliver the cost actions we set out in February. Third, although the external environment is more uncertain we are confident in our ability to deliver, and we are reaffirming our existing targets and guidance. This includes a mid-teens return on tangible equity in 2025, 2026 and 2027.\\nLouis, can we go to Q&A, please?\",\n","  'topics': ['Credit',\n","   'Market',\n","   'Liquidity & Funding',\n","   'Capital & Leverage',\n","   'Financial Crime'],\n","  'key_insights': ['Strong first quarter performance with an annualized return on tangible equity of 18.4%, excluding notable items.',\n","   'Stable credit risk metrics, with a first quarter ECL charge of $0.9 billion, including a $150 million provision for heightened economic uncertainty.',\n","   'Discipline in cost management with a target of around 3% cost growth in 2025.',\n","   'Potential impact of tariffs on credit performance, with a scenario of an incremental ECL charge of around $0.5 billion.'],\n","  'sentiment': {'label': 'neutral', 'confidence': 0.8},\n","  'risk_flags': [{'name': 'Credit',\n","    'severity': 'medium',\n","    'detail': 'ECL charge of $0.9 billion, including a $150 million provision, reflects heightened economic uncertainty.'},\n","   {'name': 'Financial Crime',\n","    'severity': 'low',\n","    'detail': 'No specific mention of financial crime risks in the provided text.'}],\n","  'kpis': [{'name': 'Return on Tangible Equity',\n","    'value': '18.4% annualized, excluding notable items'},\n","   {'name': 'ECL Charge', 'value': '$0.9 billion for the first quarter'},\n","   {'name': 'Cost Growth Target', 'value': 'Around 3% in 2025'},\n","   {'name': 'CET1 Ratio', 'value': '14.7%'}],\n","  'review_required': False,\n","  'analysis_model': 'phi-4-mini-instruct',\n","  'analysis_latency_s': 13.889},\n"," {'type': 'query',\n","  'person_type': 'participant',\n","  'name': 'Benjamin Toms',\n","  'text': \"Firstly, you mentioned in the release that you've launched a strategic review of Malta, full year results.

Certainly, some of the shipments from China specifically to the U.S. have slowed down, but we've seen no panic. So there's been no significant drawdowns.

So we've seen customers rebalance their investments between various offerings and be it various geographic equity exposure or other assets such as mutual funds or structured products. And when customers want to take a risk of approach, we see the money flow into our deposit base, so we kind of capture the customer assets either in invested assets or in deposits.

And we've seen the same trend even through April and the same trend also no panic, no drawdowns and deposit behavior normal through April. So that's just to say that.\\nComing down to distribution. So just as a starting point, we have a policy on ordinary dividends. I'm assuming your question is much more on share buybacks. But let me see overall the process we follow. Every quarter, we look at where we are in terms of a CET1. And you know our CET1 operating range is between 14% to 14.5%. We also look at our capital generation, less the capital needs or capital deployment that we want to do. And what's very important is routinely, we look at a range of scenarios in terms of the macroeconomic environment. And then based on that, we look at the quantum on share buybacks. And clearly, if we have excess capital, share buybacks continues to be our preferred method to return capital.\\nWe have not changed our view on capital redeployment. But as I've said, we look at opportunities. We look at the generator capability quarter-on-quarter, and that's how we make the decision on the quantum of share buybacks.\",\n","  'topics': ['Capital & Leverage', 'Market'],\n","  'key_insights': ['Wealth customer behaviors show confidence in double-digit growth with normal deposit behavior.',\n","   'Share buybacks are preferred for capital return when excess capital is available.',\n","   'Capital redeployment decisions are based on quarterly capital generation and macroeconomic scenarios.'],\n","  'sentiment': {'label': 'positive', 'confidence': 0.8},\n","  'risk_flags': [{'name': 'Capital & Leverage',\n","    'severity': 'low',\n","    'detail': 'Share buybacks continue as preferred method for capital return.'}],\n","  'kpis': [{'name': 'CET1 ratio',\n","    'value': 'Operating range between 14% to 14.5%'}],\n","  'review_required': False,\n","  'analysis_model': 'phi-4-mini-instruct',\n","  'analysis_latency_s': 6.986},\n"," {'type': 'answer',\n","  'person_type': 'presenter',\n","  'name': 'Georges Elhedery',\n","  'text': 'And on the redeployment of cost?',\n","  'topics': ['Cost Management',\n","   'Operational Efficiency',\n","   'Resource Allocation'],\n","  'key_insights': ['Speaker discusses redeployment of costs, indicating potential cost optimization efforts.',\n","   \"The context of 'redeployment' is unclear, requiring further information to assess impact on resource allocation.\"],\n","  'sentiment': {'label': 'neutral', 'confidence': 0.6000000000000001},\n","  'risk_flags': [{'name': 'Operational Efficiency',\n","    'severity': 'low',\n","    'detail': 'Redeployment of costs may affect operational efficiency if not managed properly.'},\n","   {'name': 'Resource Allocation',\n","    'severity': 'medium',\n","    'detail': 'Unclear redeployment strategy could lead to misallocation of resources.'}],\n","  'kpis': [{'name': 'Cost Optimization', 'value': 'Not specified'}],\n","  'review_required': True,\n","  'analysis_model': 'phi-4 (supervisor)',\n","  'analysis_latency_s': 5.999,\n","  'supervisor_latency_s': 9.568},\n"," {'type': 'answer',\n","  'person_type': 'presenter',\n","  'name': 'Manveen Kaur',\n","  'text': \"Yes, on the deployment of cost, absolutely.

Let me address your first question on ring-fencing, and Pam will take your second question on the cost. So our view on ring-fencing is that we've taken major -- I mean, there's been major enhancement to the prudential regulations for banks in the U.K. in particular, the broader regimes of capital, of loss absorbency through MREL, liquidity, recovery and resolution, et cetera. All these measures have basically put the bank in a much better safer prudential space that have made ring-fencing effectively redundant.\\nThe second thing to say is that the U.K. is the only major economy that is applied ring-fencing. So it's quite unique to the U.K. So as an outcome, it's increased the cost to operate as a bank. It created capital inefficiencies, it trapped liquidity, it effectively exposed our customers, including businesses and SMEs to higher costs. It did somewhat also stifle competition. The bar to be able to compete in the U.K. for banks has become stiffer and more difficult. So therefore, we believe that removing ring-fencing or at least scaling back on some of the ring-fencing considerations will improve the outcome for customers and ultimately, therefore, will support growth in the U.K.\\nNow just to reiterate, we are very supportive of the government's growth agenda, and we will play our role in the U.K. for that. And as regard to the financial impact of the removal or the scaling down of ring-fencing, look, we haven't done full analysis, but we believe this will be positive for both capital cost and ability to compete and support the growth of the U.K. economy and our customers.

Kian, I'm going to make some broad comments on the view of corridors and overall our business. And I'll ask Pam to give you additional information on the tariff scenarios as well as in the cost implications, okay? So a couple of things to note. The first one is as we did say, the lion's share of our banking NII is driven by our deposit franchise. This deposit franchise is a hallmark of our balance sheet. We run 50s loan-to-deposit ratio in three of our four businesses. And in the U.K., we run 80s, which is the lowest. Therefore, we have deposit surpluses in every currency, every geography, every business line, and this franchise is very robust and is a driver of a very important lion's share of our banking NII, very important revenue stream.\\nThe second, when you look at our fee income, when -- so far has continued to grow at double-digit returns, and we do expect it to continue to grow at double-digit returns in the medium term, given the underlying market opportunities and market growth as well as our own investment to continue gaining market share. So transaction banking is the one we really are diving into. Remember, first, transaction banking is a wide set of products that cover various areas outside trade. And remember, a lot of our businesses, let's say, with multinational customers operating in Asia or in China, a lot of their business is in China for China or in Asia for Asia, where they produce and manufacture locally and distribute locally with limited impact on tariffs, albeit some may be impacted by tariffs.\\nBut even within trade, we have seen growth of trade corridors intra-Asia or within Asia, Middle East at a very fast pace. And a number of these corridors have become structurally resilient and on a growth trajectory. Now some of the China Plus One trade patterns that are still meant to ultimately distribute or export to the U.S. will be affected for insofar that there's intra-Asia trade laws for that ultimate purpose. But there is a much bigger Intra-Asia -- Intra-Asia and Middle East trade flows that are 2-way and that are related to domestic manufacturing for the purposes of domestic consumption, which we continue to see as structurally growing.\\nOur scenarios have really looked at differentiation between the areas of structural growth and the areas that will be widely impacted by tariffs, which Pam can talk to.\",\n","  'topics': ['Credit',\n","   'Market',\n","   'IRRBB',\n","   'Liquidity & Funding',\n","   'Capital & Leverage',\n","   'Market – rates, FX, spreads, trading volatility',\n","   'Liquidity & Funding – outflows, deposits, LCR/NSFR',\n","   'Capital & Leverage – CET1, buffers, solvency',\n","   'Market – rates, FX, spreads, trading volatility'],\n","  'key_insights': ['Georges Elhedery highlights the robustness of the deposit franchise, which is a key driver of banking NII and a strong revenue stream.',\n","   'Fee income is expected to continue growing at double-digit rates, driven by market opportunities and strategic investments.',\n","   'Transaction banking is expanding, particularly in intra-Asia and Middle East trade corridors, which are showing structural growth.'],\n","  'sentiment': {'label': 'positive', 'confidence': 0.9},\n","  'risk_flags': [{'name': 'Market – rates, FX, spreads, trading volatility',\n","    'severity': 'low',\n","    'detail': 'Intra-Asia and Middle East trade corridors are growing, but some China Plus One trade patterns may be affected by tariffs.'}],\n","  'kpis': [{'name': 'Banking NII driven by deposit franchise',\n","    'value': '50s loan-to-deposit ratio in three businesses, 80s in the U.K.'},\n","   {'name': 'Fee income growth',\n","    'value': 'Double-digit returns expected to continue in the medium term'}],\n","  'review_required': False,\n","  'analysis_model': 'phi-4-mini-instruct',\n","  'analysis_latency_s': 12.582},\n"," {'type': 'answer',\n","  'person_type': 'presenter',\n","  'name': 'Manveen Kaur',\n","  'text': \"So thank you, Kian. So firstly, just to reiterate, the $40 billion banking NII continues to be our best estimate for full year 2025. Now we've looked at a range of reasonable upside, downside assumptions, including rates, but we are not immune to all scenarios despite the stress work that we have done. Our Q1 run rate of $10.6 billion puts us on a good trajectory given that range of scenarios you've looked at all plausible upsides and downsides.\\nNow as always, there are four key drivers. The rates that we have included are based on the mid-April curves. The structural hedge will be a tailwind to this headwind of rates. We have $75 billion maturities in the remainder of the year, and they are on 2.8% yield at the moment. So there will be an upside to that.\\nThe other two elements are harder to forecast, particularly in terms of balance sheet growth, as we've said before, and the loans stay muted. Having said that, loans and advances were slightly up in the first quarter of this year, primarily because Hong Kong loans and advances were stable compared to Q4 last year where they had conducted. Now the deposit migration trend from Hong Kong has stayed stable over last year into this year at 39%, and that is continuing even through April. So if I look at it in the round in terms of deposit behaviors of our customers, both from a corporate side and as well as from a retail side, we stay quite comfortable.\\nSo on tariffs, just in terms of the broad piece, what we have looked at from a tariff perspective is, and it's all in terms of seeing the various scenarios in terms of delivering the mid-teens RoTE. I mean, firstly, we looked at our income stream beyond banking NII, which is wholesale transaction banking. And it has many more products beyond trade finance. It also is in diverse products within trade finance and their diverse global and intra-regional corridors. Now when we have looked to the downside scenario, we've looked at higher tariffs. We have looked at impact on GDP. And we have looked more broadly on policy rates, inflation, the big picture.\\nBut again, to say we have not looked at GDP to the stress level of a downside 2 scenario that we have called out in our release, which is like a double-digit contraction of GDP as we saw in the COVID period. So if you look at all that, we come to a low single-digit percentage impact on revenues. And within that and within the incremental $500 million ECLs, we stay very confident for our mid-teens RoTE for the next 3 years.\\nNow the broader impacts are going to be hard to quantify. These are your second, third order impacts, but we'll continue to monitor them through our various scenarios and review them quarter-on-quarter. On costs, our cost trajectory is on track. And given this, there's no shift on that. And we will still continue through our envelope to be able to invest in the areas which we have been, as Georges has said, because we can see the direct benefit coming very quickly in those areas even in the current environment and continuing through April, and that's primarily on the well side.\",\n","  'topics': ['Interest Rate Risk', 'Liquidity & Funding', 'Credit', 'Market'],\n","  'key_insights': ['Banking NII remains strong at $40 billion for 2025, with a Q1 run rate of $10.6 billion.',\n","   'Structural hedge and $75 billion maturities on 2.8% yield provide a positive outlook despite rate headwinds.',\n","   'Deposit migration from Hong Kong stable at 39%, indicating customer retention and liquidity stability.'],\n","  'sentiment': {'label': 'neutral', 'confidence': 0.8},\n","  'risk_flags': [{'name': 'Interest Rate Risk',\n","    'severity': 'medium',\n","    'detail': 'Exposure to interest rate changes could impact profitability.'},\n","   {'name': 'Liquidity & Funding',\n","    'severity': 'low',\n","    'detail': 'Stable deposit migration suggests good liquidity position.'}],\n","  'kpis': [{'name': 'Banking NII', 'value': '$40 billion estimate for 2025'},\n","   {'name': 'Q1 Run Rate', 'value': '$10.6 billion'},\n","   {'name': 'Deposit Migration', 'value': '39% stable'}],\n","  'review_required': False,\n","  'analysis_model': 'phi-4-mini-instruct',\n","  'analysis_latency_s': 10.735},\n"," {'type': 'query',\n","  'person_type': 'participant',\n","  'name': 'Amit Goel',\n","  'text': \"Potentially follow-up, actually, to Kian's question.

So just in terms of the scenarios to confirm, they are not identical scenarios, but in terms of severity and plausibility, you're right in the ballpark, because the ECL scenario stresses a lot of things on interest rates, inflation, et cetera, from a range of factors, and this one on tariffs is quite specific on the revenue line. And to clarify on ECLs, we had to build our reserve for this quarter, change the weightings of the downside 1 from 15% to 30%. And when we look at the $500 million potential impact, that is, if you change that downside 1 scenario weighting to 100%. So just to say that's a $500 million additional to the $150 million.\\nNow in terms of Hong Kong and China CRE, absolutely, in terms of both from an individual customer level as well on the forward economic guidance, given the starting point, there is a lesser impact, and overall there has been very little noise from a Hong Kong CRE and China CRE other than isolated names in this quarter.

The actions taken typically is when you have colleagues put through at risk and decisions made, communicated. There is always a time lag typically between that and colleagues leaving the platform. Typically, it tends to be about 1/4, 90 days.

We don't take the upside of the mitigating actions or any other policy measures. It's purely tariffs and evaluatory tariffs in a plausible range. So all said and done, I just want to reaffirm, it was all calculated as part of the target RoTE guidance that we are giving.\\nOn loan growth, the situation is in some ways similar to where we were at the end of Q4, because macroeconomic uncertainty delays decision-making. So we are not seeing any of those CapEx decisions being brought forward or delayed. They were delayed. They will continue to be delayed hopefully at some stage when some certainty remains, there will be loan growth. We are also monitoring very closely to see if there is any increase in drawdowns just like we observed in Q2 of 2020.\\nAt this point of time, there's no increase in drawdowns. So overall, from a loan growth perspective, I would say, still muted in terms of what we are seeing. The only thing I would say is that, if there is sort of continued tariff uncertainty, you will see maybe a little bit pickup from a OpEx perspective on working capital, because when you have to pay import duties upfront and there's some delays in some of the monies coming and so on. So that's kind of will have an impact.\\nBut from a materiality perspective, the real driver for our banking NII guidance of $42 billion is really deposits for which we have a very strong franchise. We are in a privileged position to be a trusted partner for our customers, and we expect that to grow. Of course, there will be a bit of seasonal fluctuation quarter-on-quarter. But overall, that trend has continued.\",\n","  'topics': ['Credit', 'Market', 'Liquidity & Funding', 'Capital & Leverage'],\n","  'key_insights': ['Loan growth remains muted due to macroeconomic uncertainty, with no increase in drawdowns.',\n","   'Tariff uncertainty may lead to a slight increase in OpEx on working capital.',\n","   'Strong deposit franchise is expected to continue driving banking NII guidance.'],\n","  'sentiment': {'label': 'neutral', 'confidence': 0.8},\n","  'risk_flags': [{'name': 'Loan Growth',\n","    'severity': 'medium',\n","    'detail': 'Loan growth is muted, potentially impacting future revenue.'},\n","   {'name': 'Tariff Uncertainty',\n","    'severity': 'low',\n","    'detail': 'Tariff uncertainty may lead to increased OpEx on working capital.'}],\n","  'kpis': [{'name': 'Banking NII Guidance',\n","    'value': '$42 billion driven by strong deposit franchise'}],\n","  'review_required': False,\n","  'analysis_model': 'phi-4-mini-instruct',\n","  'analysis_latency_s': 8.512},\n"," {'type': 'query',\n","  'person_type': 'participant',\n","  'name': 'Unknown Analyst',\n","  'text': 'My question is also about tariffs.

So yes, indeed, customer -- I mean, look, first, the customers aren't taking any decisions in panic, customers essentially are in wait and see mode. Number of CapEx or large investments have been slowed down and certainly trade between China and the U.S., we've seen a major slowdown. But on the whole, customers are looking at their business models. They are looking at their supply chains. They're looking at ways to create more resilience in their business. And we're definitely here to help them.\\nAs I said earlier, we are our customers' trusted banking partner. They trust the strength of our financial strength, the strength of our balance sheet and our proposition. They trust the stability of our commitments to support them through their needs and through all predictable and unpredictable times.\\nAnd very importantly, they trust our expertise. We have more than 5,000 trade experts in more than 50 jurisdictions, working with clients to help them think through what this means for their business model and now how they can help them adapt and adjust and create resilience. So therefore, in an environment like this one, we expect to deepen relationships with clients. We expect to acquire new clients and to consolidate our position as a leading trade bank and we expect to make, hopefully, a difference for our customers in navigating these uncertainties. Thank you very much, Ian.\\nI think we have addressed all the questions. So I want to take this opportunity to thank all of you for your questions. So looking in closing, we had a strong quarter marked by momentum in our earnings, discipline in our execution and confidence in our ability to deliver our targets.\\nNeil and the team are available for any follow-up questions with our Investor Relations expert.

For your information, this conference is being recorded.\\nAt this time, I will hand the call over to your host, Mr. Douglas Flint, Group Chairman.\\nDouglas Flint\\nThank you very much. Good morning from London, good afternoon in Hong Kong, and welcome to the 2016 HSBC annual results call.\\nWith me today are Stuart Gulliver, Group Chief Executive; and Iain MacKay, the Group Finance Director. And before we start, I'd like to say a word on behalf of the board.\\nHSBC's performance in 2016 was broadly satisfactory against the backdrop of far-reaching geopolitical and economic developments. Operating performance in the second half of the year was much stronger than expected as businesses and financial markets responded more optimistically than predicted. The board was happy with the traction from management actions to reshape the group and address the challenges of the continuing low-interest rate environment, and these actions are bearing fruit through market share gains, greater cost efficiency and improved performance. Much of the heavy investments in reshaping the group to improve productivity embrace technological change, and reinforce global standards of business conduct has been made.\\nWe entered 2017 with the restructuring of the group essentially completed and with a strong capital position and a conservative balance sheet.\\nWe delivered in our commitments in maintaining the annual dividend in respect of the year at $0.51 as we indicated at the interim stage, and this was delivered through the declaration today of a fourth interim dividend of $0.21.\\nIn addition to this, the board has determined to return to shareholders up to a further $1 billion, by way of a share buyback.\\nLet me hand over now to Stuart to talk through the key points before Iain takes a more detailed look at our performance. Stuart?\\nStuart Gulliver\\nThanks, Douglas. So turning to Slide 2. We made good progress in 2016. The implementation of our strategic actions is actually well-advanced and our global universal business model performed well in challenging conditions.\\nThe drop in the reported profit before tax reflected a number of significant items. The noncash items included a $3.2 billion write-off of goodwill in Global Private Banking in Europe and fair value losses on our own debt of $1.8 billion.\\nThe cash items included $3.1 billion investment in our cost-reduction programs, $680 million related to legal settlements and provisions and $559 million related to U.K. customer redress. The reported number also includes a $1.7 billion accounting loss on the sale of our Brazil business.\\nOur adjusted profits were broadly unchanged year-on-year, following solid performances by our global businesses. These enabled us to capture market share in strategic product areas and build a platform for future growth. We delivered positive adjusted jaws in 2016.\\nGlobal Banking Markets recovered from a sector-wide slow start to the year to generate higher adjusted revenue than 2015. Commercial Banking performed well, particularly in the U.K. and Hong Kong, growing revenue in spite of a slowdown in global trade.\\nThe Retail Banking and Wealth Management performance was mixed. Overall revenue was down compared to 2015 due largely to the impact of reduced client activity in Hong Kong on our Wealth Management businesses. However, strong mortgage growth and higher currency accounts and savings balances helped to increase revenue in Retail Banking. And we've written off all the remaining goodwill in the European Private Banking business. This goodwill relates principally to the original purchase of Safra Republic Holdings in 1999. The restructuring of Global Private Banking is now largely complete, and although Global Private Banking is now much smaller than it was 3 years ago, it is deliberately positioned for sustainable growth with a focus on serving the personal wealth management needs of the leadership and owners of the group's corporate clients. This was reflected in 2016 through solid revenue growth from group-referred relationships. We also continue to make strong progress on our strategic actions to improve returns and gain maximum value from our international network.\\nMeanwhile, our targeted reduction of risk weighted assets is now 97% complete, and we expect to exceed our reduction target by the end of 2017.\\nOur cost-reduction programs continue to bring down our adjusted operating expenses. The traction that these programs have gained in the last 18 months has enabled us to increase the amount of cost that we're able to remove from the business. We now expect to deliver annualized savings of around $6 billion by the end of 2017, about $1 billion above our original target, and we'll invest in equivalent amounts of around $6 billion over the same time frame to achieve this.\\nImproved lending and deposit balances, interest rate rises and better collaboration between businesses helped generate significantly higher profits in our Mexico business year-on-year and significant market share gains, particularly in consumer lending.\\nWe also continued to build our business in Asia Pacific, launching our first exclusively HSBC-branded credit card in Mainland China, growing assets under management and insurance new business premiums and seeing the first lines of growth in our loan book in the Pearl River Delta. We also extended our leadership with the offshore renminbi bond market to achieve our best ranking for China outbound mergers and acquisitions since 2003.\\nWe also completed the $2.5 billion share buyback in December that we commenced at the half year. We are today announcing a second buyback of up to $1 billion to retire more of the capital that previously supported the Brazil business. Having received the appropriate regulatory clearances, we aim to complete this new buyback in the first half of 2017. This will bring the total value of shares repurchased since last August to USD 3.5 billion.\\nOur strong common equity tier 1 ratio of 13.6% reinforces our ability to invest in the business, support the dividend and consider future share buybacks and manage the continuing uncertain regulatory environment.\\nIain will talk you through the numbers.\\nIain Mackay\\nThanks, Stuart. As you may already know, we have recemented our results with the Global businesses now representing our primary reporting segments and have replaced the business line known as Other with Corporate Center to better reflect the way we manage our business. Corporate Center comprises Central Treasury, including Balance Sheet Management, our legacy businesses, interest in associates and joint ventures, central stewardship costs that support the business and the U.K. bank levy. There are more details on the Corporate Center in the appendix. Our published recementation book would also provide detailed analysis and reconciliation to this reporting change.\\nLooking quickly at some key metrics for 2016, the reported return on average ordinary shareholder's equity was 0.8%. The reported return on average tangible equity was 2.6%. On an adjusted basis, we had positive jaws of 1.2%, and we had tangible net asset value per ordinary share of $6.92. The movement in jaws was due to a 3.7% reduction in adjusted operating expenses, which exceeded the 2.5% fall in adjusted revenue in 2016. Our adjusted measure includes the impact of the bank levy.\\nTangible net asset value fell by $0.45 in the fourth quarter, driven largely by foreign currency exchange differences and movements in available-for-sale investment through other comprehensive income. There's more detail on these movements in the appendix.\\nSlide 4 shows the impact of significant items in currency translation in the fourth quarter on our reported profits and on our return on equity. The largest significant items in Q4 were noncash items, namely the $2.4 billion write-off of the remaining goodwill of the European Global Private Banking business and $1.6 billion arising from changes in credit spreads on our own debt designated at fair value. We also included a $1.1 billion of investment to achieve our cost savings.\\nAdjusted profit before tax for the fourth quarter was up 39% year-on-year. Adjusted profits for the full year were broadly stable. Our return on equity was 0.8% and our return on tangible equity was 2.6% for 2016, both adversely impacted by significant items. Excluding these items and the bank levy, our return on equity was 7.7% and the return on tangible equity was 8.5%.\\nSlide 5 provides more detail on the items that take us from reported to adjusted for both the fourth quarter and the full year. You will find more details of these adjustments in the appendix, and the remainder of the presentation focuses on adjusted numbers.\\nSlide 6 looks at fourth quarter profit before tax. Adjusted profit before tax was $738 million higher than the fourth quarter of 2015 driven by significantly lower loan impairment charges and continued robust cost management. The decrease in revenue is due predominantly to adverse valuation differences on long-term debt and associated swaps caused by sharp interest rate rises in the fourth quarter. The negative impact of these valuation differences was $742 million, compared to a negative impact of $126 million in the same period last year. The full year negative impact of this difference was $278 million.\\nWe did not forecast this for revenue purposes as we hedge these bonds over their duration and the short-term valuation differences are not meaningful. There are more details on this in the appendix. Against this, were our strong performances in Global Banking and Markets and Commercial Banking.\\nSlide 7 looks at revenue. Fourth quarter revenue from our Global businesses was $605 million higher than the last year's fourth quarter. I'll go through each business in more detail in the next few slides.\\nThe $944 million reduction in revenue of Corporate Center between the third and fourth quarters was mainly caused by the valuation difference in long-term debt and associated swaps that I've already described. Reported revenue numbers include a $396 million impact associated with foreign currency translation differences versus the third quarter. On an annual basis, our Global businesses revenue was broadly unchanged.\\nSlide 8 looks at Retail Banking and Wealth Management revenue. Revenue increased by $25 million compared to last year's fourth quarter, increased customer lending and higher deposits throughout 2016 helped grow fourth quarter Retail Banking revenue by $66 million. Wealth Management revenue also grew by $40 million, driven by investment distribution in Asia. Lending growth accelerated in the fourth quarter, particularly in mortgages in Hong Kong and the U.K. For the full year, adjusted revenue was down 2% as 1% growth in Retail Banking revenue was more than offset by a fall in Wealth Management. This was principally caused by the impact of our investment business that reduced client activity in Hong Kong, particularly in the first half of the year.\\nAs Slide 9 shows, Commercial Banking revenue was broadly stable compared to last year's fourth quarter. We continue to see strong balance sheet growth in the fourth quarter with $6 billion of additional lending and a further $11 billion of deposits. This contributed to a 5% revenue increase in Global Liquidity and Cash Management compared to last year's fourth quarter.\\nTLAC costs and the impact of market movements in Asia on insurance revenue caused revenue in Other to fall by 16%. For the full year, Commercial Banking revenue grew $534 million or 1%. This included growth in Global Liquidity and Cash Management of $181 million, driven by increased balances and wider spreads in Hong Kong. Credit and lending also increased by $83 million, reflecting continued loan growth in the U.K. These were partly offset by lower revenue in Global Trade and Receivables Finance.\\nGlobal Banking and Markets had a strong fourth quarter, increasing revenue by 23% year-on-year. Foreign exchange, rates, banking and global liquidity and cash management all grew revenue, capitalizing an increased client flows and market movements.\\nFor the full year, Global Banking and Markets revenue rose by $353 million or 2% compared to 2015. This included a net negative impact of $297 million related to adverse movements in credits and funding valuation adjustments.\\nExcluding these movements, revenue rose by $650 million or 5%, mainly in rates and credit, as we paid market share in Europe. Revenue also increased in Global Liquidity and Cash Management as we grew average balances and benefited from wider spreads. This was a good performance from Global Banking and Markets in 2016. Since 2014, adjusted risk-weighted assets in Global Banking and Markets have fallen by 14%, and adjusted revenue have risen by 10%. This demonstrated the effectiveness of both our risk-weighted asset reduction program and our targeted investment in the business.\\nSlide 11 looks at Global Private Banking, which saw a fall in revenue of $43 million or 10% compared to last year's fourth quarter. This largely reflected the continued repositioning of the business and reduced market activity.\\nDuring 2016, we disposed our private banking businesses in Bermuda and Brazil and a client portfolio in Europe. These disposals are reflected in the fall in client assets during the period. The repositioning of Global Private Banking is now substantially complete.\\nFor the full year, adjusted revenue fell by $208 million or 11%. We attracted more than $5 billion of net new money from collaborations by global business customers in 2016. Corporate Center revenue fell by $944 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. This was principally due to a net $616 million reduction from adverse valuation differences on long-term debt and associated swaps, and the loss of revenue from the run-off of our U.S. CML portfolio. Balance Sheet Management revenue rose by $133 million or 21% against last year's fourth quarter. Balance Sheet Management for the full year was up by $175 million or 7%. We reduced the remaining U.S. run-off portfolio by 49%, which contributed $8 billion of the $22 billion RWA reduction in the fourth quarter. We expect to complete the disposal of the CML assets during 2017.\\nFull year net interest margin of 173 -- 1.73%, sorry, was 15 basis points lower than 2015. 8 of those basis points came from the disposal of our operations in Brazil and currency translation differences, particularly in the U.K. and Mexico. The remainder came largely from lower yields in customer lending, including revenue lost from the run-off of our U.S. CML portfolio and an increase in the cost of debt, including around $400 million of TLAC interest costs.\\nSlide 14 looks at operating expenses. Our operating expenses, excluding the bank levy, increased by 5% from the prior fiscal quarter, reflecting a small number of specific items, and these included a write-off of around $150 million relating to software that we no longer use and a spending increase related to marketing programs launched in the fourth quarter.\\nOur cost performance in 2016 was excellent with a $1.2 billion or 4% drop in adjusted operating expenses. We removed $2.2 billion of costs from the business in 2016, bringing a total annualized run rate savings since we started our cost savings program to around $3.7 billion.\\nOur U.K. bank levy charge was $499 million lower than 2015, including a positive adjustment of $128 million relating to previous year. These reductions were partially offset by the impact of inflation and further investment in regulatory programs and compliance.\\nOur total expenditure in regulatory programs and compliance was $3 billion, which was around $4 million or 14% higher than in 2015. We expect an increase of more than 10% in regulatory and compliance costs in 2017.\\nSlide 15 walks you from 2014 operating expenses to a revised 2017 exit run rate target. While we are investing more in regulatory and compliance programs, we're also continuing to invest in growth and improvements in the business. We will more than pay for this investment through additional cost savings, which will require additional one-off investments to remove these costs from the business. We've already invested around 90% of the amount that we originally said we would by the end of 2017 to achieve our target cost savings and improve the operating capabilities and productivity of the group.\\nWe now expect to invest a total of around $6 billion by the end of 2017 to achieve total run rate cost savings of around $6 billion, around $1 billion above the top end of our Investor Day target range.\\nSlide 16 looks at loan impairment charges. Fourth quarter LICs were down $83 million from the third quarter of 2016, down $825 million compared to fourth quarter of 2015. Fourth quarter LICs for 2016 had no outstanding features, and the credit outlook remains benign. There is no small -- there is no small part due to the strength of our risk management and portfolio repositioning since 2011.\\nIn 2016, as a whole, loan impairment charges were $48 million higher than 2015 due to a small number of individually assessed LICs in Global Banking and Markets, raising oil and gas and mining sectors in the U.S. in the first half of the year. There were also higher charges in Retail Banking and Wealth Management, particularly in Mexico as we grew our market share of retail and consumer banking products. These entries were mostly offset by a large reduction in Commercial Banking charges.\\nSlide 17 breaks down adjusted profit for 2016 by global business and geography. The overall story is unchanged since the third quarter. Adjusted profit before tax was down by $228 million or 1% due to lower revenue and marginally higher loan impairment charges, but this was largely offset by good progress in costs. The effectiveness of our cost-reduction program means that we achieved positive jaws of 1.2% in 2016 in spite of a tough revenue environment.\\nWe generated a further $38 billion of risk-weighted asset reductions in the fourth quarter, bringing total reductions for the year to $142 billion. $17 billion of the fourth quarter total came from Global Banking and Markets and legacy credit. $8 billion came from our U.S. CML one-off portfolios, $5 billion from Commercial Banking and $8 billion from other, mainly in Balance Sheet Management. The total reduction since the start of 2015 now stands at $267 billion, around 44% of which came from Global Banking and Markets and legacy credit. This takes us more than 97% of the way towards our target, which we expect to exceed through continued focus on efficient capital deployment.\\nTurning to capital, the group's common equity tier 1 ratio was 13.6% in 31 December, compared with 13.9% at the end of the third quarter. Common equity tier 1 capital reduced by $9 billion in the fourth quarter, due mainly to foreign exchange movements, dividends and reported loss for the period. Impact of this reduction in our common equity tier 1 ratio was mitigated by the reduction in risk-weighted assets. Today's buyback announcement reduces common equity tier 1 ratio to 13.5%.\\nSlide 20 looks to the year ahead. Our financial targets maintain our focus on improving returns, delivering cost productivity consistently and providing sustainable returns to shareholders. Our medium-term revenue prospects remain good, supported by loan growth and strong deposit growth in 2016 and steeper yield curves and rising interest rates in the U.S. and Hong Kong.\\nOur restructured business is increasingly well-positioned to capture further opportunities, and our Global businesses [indiscernible] momentum from the fourth quarter into the start of 2017. We have traction in our cost management and productivity improvement programs with persistent focus in improving returns supported by continued commitment to capital efficiency.\\nUncertainty in the geopolitical and regulatory environments were main considerations. There are also a number of near-term revenue headwind that are worth bearing in mind. Restating 2016 reported revenues based on average January 2017 foreign exchange rates would reduce them by $2 billion. Clearly, costs benefited from such FX movements.\\nWe expect around $500 million of additional TLAC interest costs in 2017 and a potential $300 million revenue impact from lower U.K. interest rates.\\nIt's also worth remembering that while the run-off of our U.S. CML legacy portfolio is clearly good news, we will lose the revenue associated with the assets that we sell as well as the associated impairment losses.\\nI'll now hand back to Stuart.\\nStuart Gulliver\\nThanks, Iain. So Slide 21 shows our progress [indiscernible] actions we outlined at our investor update in June 2015. We're now 18 months into a 2.5-year program, and a large majority of actions remain on track. We're going to beat our original targets to reduce both risk-weighted assets and costs, as Iain has already said.\\nMexico also continues to recover strongly, adjusted PBT more than tripled in 2016 and revenue grow 18% year-on-year. We grew lending by 14%, increasing our market share of personal loans, payroll loans and mortgages and raising our advances to deposit ratio. We also grew Global Trade, Receivables Finance and Global Liquidity and Cash Management revenues in Mexico by 11% and 19%, respectively.\\nThe low-interest rate environment, however, continued to keep the U.S. business off-track, although adjusted revenues in Global Banking and Markets and Retail Banking and Wealth Management both grew in 2016. The network benefits of the U.S. business have also increased as we grew revenue from the international subsidiaries of our U.S. clients by 11% compared with 2015.\\nThe establishment of the U.K. ring-fenced bank remains on track. Both the chair and CEO positions of HSBC U.K. have now been filled, following the announcements of Clara Furse as Chair and Ian Stuart as Chief Executive.\\nThe migration of roles from London to Birmingham is around 35% complete, with the remainder on track to be in place by the time the bank launches in 2018. Our international network continued to drive revenue growth in our transaction banking product lines. Level of liquidity in Cash Management revenue increased by 6% year-on-year, and Global Trade and Receivables Finance captured further market share in strategic markets, including Hong Kong and Singapore.\\nIn 2016, we were named Best Bank for Corporates by Euromoney and Best Supply Chain Finance Bank at the Trade Finance Awards.\\nWe continue to invest for growth in Asia. We launched a new digital banking platform for SMEs in Guangdong, a growing business around the China-led Belt and Road initiative, and we were named Asia's Best Investment Bank and Asia's Best Bank for Financing by Euromoney. Assets under management in Asia increased by 11%, and we grew revenue from the international subsidiaries of our ASEAN region commercial banking clients.\\nWe continue to be the leading bank for international renminbi products and services, and we're better protected from financial crime because of our investments in our Global Standards program. Our Monitor has raised certain concerns, but we will continue to progress and our commitment remains unwavering.\\nBy the end of this year, we're on track to have our AML and sanctions policy framework in place and to have introduced major compliance IT systems across the group. Beyond 2017, we will continue to work to fine-tune those systems and ensure that our improvements are fully integrated into our day-to-day risk management practices.\\nSo to conclude, I'd like to leave you with 4 points. First, our strategy is working. Our global businesses are performing well in challenging operating conditions. Our international network, our main differentiator, is delivering more than 45% of client revenue. We're capturing market share in strategic areas. We have an unrivaled business in Asia with strong returns and good momentum. And we've delivered positive adjusted jaws in 2016, and we expect to do this again in 2017.\\nSecond, we're doing what we've said we'd do. We're going to exceed both our original risk-weighted asset and cost reduction targets. We sold our Brazil business, which allowed us to complete the first share buyback in our history and to announce today a second buyback of $1 billion. Our Mexico business is being turned around quickly and effectively, and our investment in Asia is delivering more revenue for the group in strategic areas.\\nThird, more than ever, there's a big advantage in being a diversified global bank. The complexity of the current environment and the potential difficulty in connecting customers with strong growth opportunities, naturally benefits the bank with our network and heritage. The world is evolving into big regional trading blocks with less global trade, with vastly increased regional trade in the areas where barriers are falling fastest are the regions where HSBC is strongest. Our long-standing and growing, strength in infrastructure and project financing in Asia and Europe also positioned us perfectly to capitalize on opportunities arriving from the China-led Belt and Road initiative and the rising prominence of green finance.\\nFinally, we remain a well-funded business with strong capital generation, a diversified balance sheet and an excellent record of delivering value for shareholders. Last year, we delivered a total shareholder return of 36% in Hong Kong dollars, while building a common equity tier 1 ratio of 13.6%. We've maintained the dividend in 2016 and we're confident doing so for the foreseeable future.\\nWe're now happy to take questions. The operator will explain the procedure, and introduce the first question. Operator?\\nOperator\\n[Operator Instructions] We will now take our first question from Ronit Ghose from Citigroup.\\nRonit Ghose\\nCan I just pick up on a couple of points relating to revenues? Q4 seems to be a bit of disappointment, vis-a-vis market expectation, maybe just better forecasting. But you're highlighting lots of 2017 challenges, while talking up the medium term. And if you can just dig into this please, on specifically the growth outlook, you say you're very well-positioned -- you're well-positioned for growth in Asia. Loan growth is running at about 4% right now in Asia for you. Do you expect that run rate to accelerate from 4%? In your statements, you've mentioned some of the leading indicators, macro indicators are picking up, trade is picking up. Yet it's pretty uncertain in terms of outlook. So I'm just wondering if that kind of 4% revenue sort of loan growth -- 4% loan growth can be stronger in your Asian footprint this year. Linked to that on the revenues, the margins -- is most of the margin, the underlying margin weakness that you've seen in Q4, down to loan spreads coming down? And how much more sort of pressure do you expect on the spread in the U.K. and the U.S., particularly in the U.K? And finally, on the one-offs, the -- there's a $1 billion swing in treasury that Iain obviously called out. And I'm just curious as to why you're not putting that into the one-offs. And can you say that you expect this to kind of net to 0 over time? How should we try to think about that treasury revenue number?\\nIain Mackay\\nThere's a loss in here. I think from -- I mean, Stuart can provide some context on this. We clearly don't include based on loan growth coming through our Global Banking and Markets, and we saw encouragement coming through retail bank as well in the fourth quarter of last year with some momentum coming into 2017. But I think the growth rates that you referred to, Ronit, around 4% to 5%, are probably in line with what we are presently seeing and what we would expect to see through 2017 in that particular area. Moving on to margins, there are a couple of factors coming through in the fourth quarter. You will notice, and we commented here, that again you got accelerated reductions in our U.S. CML run-off portfolio in the fourth quarter and notwithstanding that, that historically has been a loss-making portfolio. It is a very strong NIM portfolio, and as we continue to sell and run-off those assets, that feeds through to NIM. The other factor that we saw in the fourth quarter was the impact really of the MIL [ph] or TLAC, depending on what you want to call it, coming through in the fourth quarter, having issued last year over $31 billion worth of instruments into the marketplace to meet those regulatory requirements. And another factor that was an influence in the fourth quarter was the impact of the bank rate reduction earlier in the year. That was certainly reflected in the fourth quarter. And I think those are probably 2 of the main features that come through in that regard. FX, again, quite a [indiscernible].\\nStuart Gulliver\\nImpact coming from the weakness in Mexican peso and Chinese renminbi, the Egyptian pound and, of course, the U.K. pound, which also, if you translate them into U.S. dollars, has a sort of negative impact. And loans and advances actually grew quite strongly in the fourth quarter, which is to say is why we can see some revenue growth, but not above that 4%, 5% handle. The specific thing that caused a lot of the miss against honest estimates in the revenue line is specifically around debt issued, and Iain you should just talk about that a little bit as to, as you say, why it's not in significant items.\\nIain Mackay\\nYes, if you look at the total year impact, we have a number of long-dated bonds outstanding, part of the overall funding structure for the group. And those are matched by interest rate swaps. So those are fixed-rate instruments, hedged, swapped into floating because majority of our book is floating-rate and they are matched economically across the duration. What we clearly saw, some of the longer-dated bonds, as what we saw in the fourth quarter, is we saw a little bit of winding in the valuation curve. So the bond is valued off a LIBOR curve and the swap by convention is valued off the overnight Index swap rate. And there's a little bit of divergence that came through in that regard, which impacted more in the fourth quarter than have been over the course of the year. If you look to the total year, the impact was less -- it was about $200 million, $270 million for the full year impact. We haven't historically seen a great deal of volatility coming through this, and we don't really do anything particular from a forecasting perspective for the reasons that I described, is that if you hold these bonds and the economic hedge swap against them due to maturity, the impact should broadly migrate towards 0. This has really been a relatively insignificant feature within the P&L and within the revenue line over recent quarters, and it was really part of that yield -- the current yield that we saw in the second half year that largely influenced it. Whether we reclassify this going forward, I think, will largely depend on the volatility that we see coming through this. But to be clear, we'll provide insight to it when we do see it coming through every quarter.\\nRonit Ghose\\nCan I just have a quick supplementary on the RBWM revenues? You called out as well you mentioned there's a weakness in Wealth. Is that client activity or is that sort of the traditional life insurance type returns, it's like an investment return weakness in the first quarter? Is that client volumes slowing in the fourth quarter?\\nStuart Gulliver\\nNo, it's actually the first half. And actually, it was an incredibly strong first half of 2015, it's Hong Kong Shanghai stock connect, and then remember that first quarter 2016 was a really slow start and quite difficult for everything related to capital markets, generally. That created weakness in the first quarter first half in Wealth Management, particularly in Hong Kong, and the second half never made it back up.\\nRonit Ghose\\nBut it looks like -- maybe I misread it, but it looks like Q3 was really strong and Q4 was a bit weaker, a couple of hundred million weaker quarter-on-quarter in Hong Kong Wealth or in [indiscernible] Wealth.\\nStuart Gulliver\\nNo, I think what we saw coming through was fairly good numbers from a Retail Banking perspective rather than the wealth piece. So Hong Kong there's big growth in deposits [indiscernible] deposits in the Retail Banking space.\\nIain Mackay\\nYes, and I think what we also see seasonally within the Asian business, with Hong Kong in particular, is a little bit of repositioning around the end of the year. So from an investment distribution perspective, the revenue was down slightly in the fourth quarter versus the third, but nothing of particular note.\\nOperator\\nOur next question today comes from Alastair Ryan from Bank of America.\\nAlastair Ryan\\n[indiscernible] So the net interest margin, just coming back to that, is 1.75% in the first half, 1.73% for the full year. How should we think about sort of the exit run rate and how quickly the December dollar rate hike starts to outweigh the earlier in 2016 rate cuts in place around the U.K? Second, Iain, just on your comments on the CML. Now you're quite clear you hope to be out of that in 2017. Did I understand correctly that the entities will be gone as well then, because, clearly, in the past, they have been a big consumer of stress test capital for you? And thirdly, just on your comment on Slide 20, an encouraging start to the year. Can I encourage you to quantify encouraging?\\nIain Mackay\\nOkay, so I'll start. On NIM, just going back, taking the fourth quarter discrete where NIM in the fourth quarter was 160 basis points. Now if you take out the annualized effect of Brazil, on a year-to-date basis during the third quarter, you take out the annualized effect of Brazil, that's 10 basis points. You then have about a 5 or 6 basis point move between the third quarter and the fourth quarter. That's contributed to buyout a little bit of asset compression coming through U.K. mortgages. So what we clearly saw last year was a pretty competitive environment for U.K. mortgages. We competed in that market more broadly with strengthening our presence in the broker channel, as we've talked about over the course of the year. So we saw a little bit of spread compression coming through there. At the end of the year and beginning of this year, you probably noticed there was coverage by the fact that some of the better-priced products in that space had been withdrawn just as we responded to some of the pressures in that area. Other factors coming through I've already mentioned, one of it was the CML portfolio, and TLAC costs. But the discrete fourth quarter was 160 basis points, Alistair. In terms of CCAR and CML, we'll have substantially all of the assets. And by that, I mean we expect being well under $1 billion of remaining unpaid principal balances, probably around $300 million to $400 million of unpaid principal balances outstanding by the time we get to the half year. Now when you reflect on that from a CCAR and a DFAST stress-testing perspective in the U.S. it's the asset portfolio that's caused the stress. It's not per se -- it's not the existence of the legal entity. So what we would expect to have accomplished by the half year is substantially all the assets be gone and the process of winding down the legal entity has in actual fact already commenced. That is a state-by-state regulated business in the U.S. and as we come out of a state with no further loans understanding, we start rationalizing those legal entities. And clearly, for a number of years now, have been rationalizing the infrastructure supporting that business. But the cause of stress coming through CCAR and DFAST was the asset portfolio. So as that goes, the opportunity to be stressed in that regard will go with it. And in terms of encouraging, I mean, I think on Chart 20, as you see, we've laid out some of the short-term pressures that we see. Clearly, foreign exchange had an adverse impact on revenues last year. Those are [indiscernible] particularly moving in an encouraging direction in an early part of the year. We will continue with a 30 -- just over $31 billion of MREL instruments out in the market last year. Consistent with previous guidance, we've got somewhere between 60 to 80 to do, so the 2017 should be a reasonably big year in that regard once again and there will be some costs associated with that. Lower U.K. interest rate, that's just really the full year impact of what we saw happen in the bank rate area in 2016, and then there's a CML. But we do see those as largely being short-term influences. But what we have seen and we talked about it earlier is the growth coming through the Asian business and notwithstanding some of the geopolitical uncertainty in the U.K. That business performed well in Commercial Banking, Global Banking and Markets over the course of 2016 as well, and hopefully carrying some momentum into 2017. So I think in the run, we're reasonably optimistic, but we do have some short-term revenue headwinds to deal with.\\nStuart Gulliver\\nJust Alistair, the rate rise in December probably adds about $300 million to the NI of 2017 and about $500 million to $600 million in subsequent years. We've assumed 2 rate rises in this year, but in the second half of the year. So if we have a rate rise in March, that will be obviously be an earlier benefit for us. January was a strong month. GBM had a strong January, but obviously, that type of business you can't really extrapolate, but it had a strong January and so did RBWM as the impact of higher rates came through the deposit base, which is essentially the number I've just mentioned.\\nOperator\\nNext question today comes from Chira Barua from Bernstein.\\nChirantan Barua\\nThree quick ones. One, Iain, you mentioned about the CML portfolio and the wind down. We've always been interested in the excess capital there. You've announced $1 billion buyback right now from your Brazilian proceeds. How should we think about now the excess capital, when do you hear from the Fed next and when will you communicate with The Street with regards to what you do with capital repatriation from the U.S.? That's number one. Second, the reg and compliance cost just keeps going up and up. I mean, it's a significant item, and I know that you've brought in a new cost plan. It will be great to understand how do you see the $3 billion, $3.5 billion going forward over the next 3, 4 years, what is the key and what is not? And the third, a quick technical question. Your rate sensitivity on Rest of Asia has gone up sharply from the first half. Is there a liquidity book that you have moved to China and Singapore, somewhere else? Just want to understand what's driving that uptick in sensitivity.\\nIain Mackay\\nOkay, from a CML perspective or more broadly U.S. capital, we had within our CCAR submission for 2016 a dividend proposal from the U.S. holding company to the parent in early 2017. So actually, at the beginning of the second quarter in 2017. That capital plan raised no objection from the Federal Reserve, so we would expect that dividend to proceed in the early second quarter of this year. When that does proceed, we'll let you know, obviously, what the number is. Broadly speaking, we've described having in excess of $8 billion of surplus capital in the U.S., and that's been informed by the portfolio repositioning over the course of the last few years, the disposition of the credit card business back in 2012, '13, the run-off of the CML portfolio, the overall reshaping of the business. I think we've also guided that the expectation in terms of being able to move the surplus capital out of the U.S. also clearly continuing to invest appropriately in the growth of our U.S. business is something that's likely to take 3 to 5 years and certainly one of the things that informs that, in fact, the key thing that informs that, is us continuing to be successful in our CCAR submissions, our next one will be in the 1st of April of this year, and ensuring that we continue to improve our overall capacity to plan, forecast and manage the capital position within our U.S. business. But I think we certainly remain very confident in terms of being able to get the capital position in the U.S. to an appropriate standing with respect to the risks and the business that we run in the U.S., and thereby repatriating capital to the parent company. But we'll keep you posted.\\nStuart Gulliver\\nSo on regulatory programs and compliance, so as you noted, it's -- the total expenditure was about $3 billion. In 2016, it's about $400 million higher than in 2015. Of this, the spend on Global Standards was about $1.6 billion in 2016 within that $3 billion number. And probably, the expenditure on Global Standards peaks in 2017, we expect the implementation of systems and IT platform to oversee that therefore enable us to scale without incremental costs going up with that scaling. However, this is part of our BAU, so I would not expect us to see a material reduction either in that $3 billion number. But as I say, 2017 should be the peak number, but then I would expect us to see that repeat in 20 years.\\nIain Mackay\\nI think going back just momentarily to your capital question, Chira. How do we deal with that? I mean, the capital that comes back to the parent company in the form of dividends, capital transactions like the Brazilian disposal, any dividends that we've received from the U.S. legal entity or any other presumes the general capital pool of the parent company. And the deployment of that is focused on investing to grow the business, supporting the dividend for shareholders. And as we've said, from time to time, as appropriate, we'll consider buybacks. I wouldn't necessarily link any of the capital actions specifically to buybacks or anything else. It becomes part of the general pool, which Stuart and the management team, along with the board, then make decisions around how that is attributed to the various priorities.\\nStuart Gulliver\\nSo the Asia Pacific rate sensitivity, pretty big growth in deposits in China. Remember, China sits in our Asia Pacific number. Big rate move down in China on that deposit base, so much more rate sensitive. There's no book being moved.\\nOperator\\nNext question today comes from the line of Raul Sinha from JPMorgan.\\nRaul Sinha\\nIf I can have 2 please. Just the first one on the rate sensitivity again. I think you've been very clear on the short end of the curve and the sensitivity to that. But you also mentioned steepening of the U.S. and the Hong Kong yield curves. And so I was wondering if you could maybe talk a little bit about the sensitivity to the mid or the long end of the curve and how you might be positioned or changing your positioning on that, especially in Q4.\\nIain Mackay\\nAgain, not much really when you think about what were the U.S. dollar rate really benefited in the second half last year, it was at the long end, it was 10 years and beyond. When you look at the asset composition of our balance sheet, we don't have a particularly large component of the balance sheet. In fact, the relatively small proportion of the balance sheet is longer dated, with the majority really sitting below 5 years. So clearly, steepening of the curve helps us. It's going to take longer to work its way through the asset base and real results in terms of uptick. So what helps us are policy rate increases and movements in the shorter end of the curve. And so it's a help, but it does not have the same impact as things at the shorter end.\\nThe way to think about that enhancement is it's a 3-year number.\\nRaul Sinha\\nOkay, that's helpful.\\nStuart Gulliver\\nIt's kind of 1 month, 3 years is steep, we can't have a lot money riding down that curve. But think about a 3 years number. So what the 10-year or 30-year does is not that relevant.\\nIain Mackay\\nAnd I think, broadly speaking, if you think about it in these terms, we talked about this before. A rising rate environment you're generally going to see that improvement coming through in the businesses, Retail Bank, Wealth Management, Commercial Bank, Global Banks and Markets, with a possible downside to that within Balance Sheet Management. But by the same token, you will have seen highly consistent earnings coming through Balance Sheet Management over the course of the last 4 or 5 years where it is consistently falling within the $2.5 billion to $3 billion this year being at the peak end of that range.\\nRaul Sinha\\nOkay. And just the second one, we haven't talked about asset quality yet on the call. But obviously, it's very a good quarter. I think you had some write-backs in Q4 as well. But clearly, some of your peers have had different experiences more recently. And obviously, you've got quite a low risk profile in the balance sheet. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about what's the real underlying run rate you see in terms of provisions and what your thoughts are in terms of the outlook. Can it get better from this or is this as good as it gets?\\nIain Mackay\\nLook, I think one of the things -- certainly, as a couple of the Asian banks came out with their results last week, we had a quick call with our colleagues in Hong Kong over the weekend just to get any really up-to-date feedback about what we saw coming through. And the story has been remarkably consistent in terms of asset quality across Retail Bank, Commercial Banking, Global Banking and Markets. The year was clearly impacted by higher provisions on metals and mining and oil and gas sector, principally in our North American businesses. But that being said, we saw some credits coming through in Commercial Banking business in those sectors as the year progressed. But credit quality, whether you look at it from a China perspective, Hong Kong, the wider Asian, the U.K., the European, it remains very, very stable. And there are no really adverse indicators at this point coming through the book. Questions have been put to us earlier this morning by Reuters, Bloomberg, for example, is have we seen any impact from Brexit. And at this point in the game, no, we absolutely haven't. So I think overall credit quality remains stable. We did get some credits coming through in the fourth quarter, which gives us probably a slightly artificial view. But again, we're in a fairly benign point in the cycle. I am, as you know, notoriously disinclined to forecast LICs from a basis point as a percentage of outstanding loans. But again, if you sort of take kind of where you saw oil and gas, metals and mining, exposure has been dealt with by us in the course of the late 2015 and '16. And normalized for that, you get some sense as to where the run rate might be.\\nRaul Sinha\\nSure. But Iain, any thoughts on IFRS 9 and how that might change in terms of should we start to think about that from 2018 in terms of your provision?\\nIain Mackay\\nWell, the industry is certainly thinking about it big time, I think more probably in terms of the context of how it affects capital and volatility within the capital ratio. Thinking about this over the duration of our loan, it shouldn't change. If we maintain consistent underwriting and discipline in terms of how we manage the book, it should not change the lifetime loss experience. However, the timing with which that gets recognized from a Stage 1, Stage 2, Stage 3 perspective, and IFRS 9 clearly could or almost certainly will introduce some volatility. And if you were to see significant sectoral downturns, again, I'll refer back to the stuff we saw in oil and gas at the end of 2015, that would move quite a lot of the book into Stage 2, and you'd see some significant upward volatility, upward movement and one with impairment charges. But from a lifetime credit cost perspective, it shouldn't change, unless we allow that short-term volatility to further feed [ph] to how we actually underwrite and manage the exposure. And I think that's something we could focus on. If you step back from the standard itself, I think the area where our regulators are beginning, but only just beginning to think about, is how that leads through to a potential short-term volatility in capital ratios and how they deal with that. So look, the industry is full-steam ahead in implementing the standard, and it goes in the 1st of January next year. You will see volatility. In the FDI, what you'll see is credit losses are recognized much, much earlier in the cycle. Whether that necessarily is a good thing remains to be seen, but lifetime impacts should remain reasonably consistent.\\nRaul Sinha\\nOkay. And when -- just quickly, when do you think we might get some guidance in terms of the impact or the upfront impact of IFRS 9?\\nIain Mackay\\nSecond half.\\nOperator\\nNext question today comes from Claire Kane from Cr\\u00e9dit Suisse.\\nClaire Kane\\nA couple of follow-up questions on the revenue outlook, please. Firstly, on the NIM, I think you said 160 basis points for Q4. Did you say that the like-for-like sequential impact was minus 5 bps, so Q3 was 165? And also, could you explain if there was any hedging impact in there or was that 5 bps broadly related to just the U.K.? And then my second point is on the MREL or TLAC guidance. You said it would go up to $0.9 billion for 2017. Can you confirm that, that is our long-term run rate? Or should we expect that's been additional impact going into '18 and beyond if you need to be MREL-compliant by 2021? And then finally, my third question, just really to wrap it up. Clearly, from the headwinds you flagged in terms of FX broadly relates to the first half of '16. So if we consider the second half adjusted revenue run rate of around just under $49 billion, consensus is looking for around 6% uplift year-on-year versus that run rate. Given your commentary around volumes, do you think that's reasonable in the context of the NIM pressures?\\nStuart Gulliver\\nIain, go ahead.\\nIain Mackay\\nSo to be clear, the 5 bps, you're right, the 5 bps impact, it was influenced by the factors I mentioned earlier in the call with U.K. -- compression in U.K. mortgages was one of the contributors. That was about 2 or 3 basis points. TLAC and CML one-off were the other contributors. There was no real notable impact from hedging coming through in the fourth quarter. It was informed by assets on the balance sheet and movements within that. From an MREL perspective, the long-term guidance that we provided is consistent, $60 billion to $80 billion based on firming up guidance coming from our regulators as to exactly how much is required, where it is required to be positioned, the characteristics of it. Clearly, there is a first threshold, which is compliant by 2019, and that's really what we've focused on. So within that time frame, somewhere between USD 60 billion to USD 80 billion of issuance to be accomplished; $31 billion accomplished in 2016. Broadly speaking, assuming there's good reception for this in the marketplace, we'd expect it to be much the same in 2017. And to the extent that any further issuance is required, we'll complete that in 2018, then reach the first threshold of compliance in 2019. Clearly, as you point out, the final compliance time line around the full implementation of MRELs is 2022. So I think based on the guidance we are today, the $900 million is broadly consistent, subject to whether or not there is more that needs to be done in 2018. And I think we really need greater clarity in guidance around quantification and characterization and frequency of MREL from our regulators, not only in Europe, but further afield because there's -- it's not called MREL outside Europe, it's called TLAC. But it is a global phenomenon that needs to be implemented. But I wouldn't change the long-term guidance in that regard at this point. In terms of overall revenue outlook for 2017, I'm not really super keen on filling out the old spreadsheet for you there. So we've given you some pretty good guidance around what we think the FX impact is, with our other short-term pressures that we've highlighted, but we've also talked to the kind of growth that we see coming through the business. And what we've seen certainly in the fourth quarter and the first few weeks of 2017 has been encouraging in that regard.\\nClaire Kane\\nOkay. Could I maybe just have one follow-up then? In terms of the NII trajectory versus the Q4 run rate, do you think volumes would more than mitigate the NIM pressure that you've guided to relative to the Q4 base?\\nIain Mackay\\nWe will certainly be focused on the management of the assets that we underwrite. Our teams in BSM do a great job of managing the overall liquidity portfolio and interest rate risk, and they're booked for us. So our focus will be in trying to mitigate NIM pressures and continue to grow volumes to offset that, but also to grow volumes in a way that accrete returns for the business. That's a discipline which Samir and his colleagues, Noah and his colleagues, John and his colleagues are very focused on is putting business on the books that bring us to improved returns against risk-weighted assets and returns on equity in the business. And I think when you look at the return in risk-weighted assets and the improvements that Global Banking and Markets have realized, Commercial Banking have realized, that is encouraging, and that's a discipline that's going to remain in place.\\nOperator\\nNext question today comes from Tom Rayner from Exane.\\nThomas Rayner\\nJust a couple of questions, please. If we can actually just go back to the share buyback announcement because you're fairly clear that this is a first half buyback and it's very much linked still to the capital release from Brazil. So my question is once we get to, say, the interim stage that the CCAR is behind you and assuming there's no problems with any of that, is it fair to assume that then it's like a clean page for the rest of the year, we shouldn't take this $1 billion necessarily as a proxy for what you're planning to do for the year as a whole? That's my first question. And then I've got another question on the revenue headwinds, if that's okay.\\nStuart Gulliver\\nSo yes, Tom, what you should assume is that as we have evidence last year, we're starting to obviously manage our capital in a much more active way than we've been able to do previously because at 13.6%, 13.5% after this buyback, we are in a good position. And what we'll be doing is looking at what our capital position is. First of all, trying to actually not have this as surplus capital, but actually use it in the business by obviously putting on risk-weighted assets as accretive returns. If we can't put them out as accretive returns and assuming that we're nicely covered on the dividend, it's possible, subject to regulatory approval, we might look at doing further buybacks. So the first priority has got to be to see if we can actually make this work within the business, and that will be the huge focus of all of the teams. The focus of the teams is not essentially to see if we can buy back; the focus of the teams is to see if we can get accretive RWAs to close within the business. So yes, I think the way you'd characterize it is that you get to the interims with a blank sheet of paper is the way to think about it. But I don't think you should raise expectations and start modeling perpetual buybacks; we won't be doing that. If we actually do see reasonable growth coming around, if we see higher interest rates, as I've said earlier, Balance Sheet Management, the whole series of books make a lot of money and we have a north to $3 billion [ph] area, we got steeper curves, we'll actually be using that capital up in the business.\\nThomas Rayner\\nOkay. Okay, very clear. Just on the revenue headwind, just a little bit more color. You mentioned TLAC, I think, Iain, you've said the sort of $900 million for now is the guidance. I'm assuming that is -- the $900 million is a net figure, that's not a sort of cost of the new TLAC, which will be offset by some uneligible debt maturing. Is that right, what I'm thinking about?\\nIain Mackay\\nThat side is the negative carry we've talked about, Tom. Clearly, the focus within the business is to find ways of deploying that higher cost debt in a way that we can mitigate our negative carry to the extent possible. So again, that's a focus in which Balance Sheet Management is zeroed in. And clearly, we bring the expertise to bear from clearly Stuart's experience as well as Samir and the teams in terms of how we mitigate that. But that is a negative carry that we're projecting.\\nThomas Rayner\\nSure. And then just on the FX. You flagged up the $2 billion headwind if rates stay at the January level. But obviously, as it works through the P&L, it's going to affect the other lines as well. How should that drop down to sort of pretax or even net income in terms of headwind? Would it be the same sort of percentage impact all the way down the income statement?\\nIain Mackay\\nSo Tom, we would certainly expect to see some kind of corresponding benefit coming through the operating expenses, which mitigates some of that headwind that we see coming through revenues from FX. So I think if you sort of think of it in broad terms, perhaps about 30% that we see having an adverse impact on the P&L because we get some benefit coming through on impairment charges and operating expenses.\\nThomas Rayner\\nYes, okay. I'm sorry, just one very final one from me. On the -- you specifically mentioned sort of the mortgage pressure in the U.K. I'm just trying to get a sense of whether you view this as a market phenomenon or is it a real push for market share by you guys, you're happy to maybe trade off that volume margin? Or do you think it's the market itself, it's becoming more competitive?\\nIain Mackay\\nWell, I mean, certainly, this is the area where Francesca and Antonio in the U.K. could give us much more insight and detail on what's happening on a day-to-day basis. But it clearly was a competitive marketplace in 2016, true in '15, that the team in the U.K. engaged much more actively with selected brokers, to give ourselves line of sight to a larger share of the U.K. market. And from a volumes and stock perspective, we grew market share in 2016. And -- but it is clearly competitive from a pricing perspective. I think we had one of the best-priced products in the marketplace in 2016 for a significant period of time. And in the latter, I would say, the latter part of the year or very early this year, we took that particular offering off the marketplace. So it goes back to Stuart's comment. We are absolutely focused on growing our market share in products that we know we can make good returns on. But by the same token, there's a very strong focus on return generation within the business and continue to improve those returns, both in terms on return on risk-weighted assets and the wider capital equation around return on equity. So discipline around net capital deployment is the heightened and increasing level within the firm.\\nOperator\\nOur next question today comes from the line of Martin Leitgeb from Goldman Sachs.\\nMartin Leitgeb\\nI just have 3 questions, and the first one is a follow-up on earlier comments on the rate sensitivity. And I was just wondering if you could give us a steer in terms of currency denomination of your deposit base and to what percentage of your global deposits are denominated in either U.S. dollar or Hong Kong dollar. And obviously, we get the -- we got some steals debt coming from the booking location of the deposits, which would imply slightly shy of 50% on those currencies. But I was just wondering if you could give us an idea if that is the right number or if the number could be meaningfully higher in terms of U.S. dollar, Hong Kong dollar deposit exposure. The second question is to follow up on your just previous comment on Tom's question on the U.K. mortgage space. And I get a bit of sense, looking at pricing relative to market, that it seems like something held you back a little bit during the year in terms of mortgage growth in the U.K. And it seems also that the growth has accelerated in the second half. And I was just wondering if this has to do further with your rollout of intermediary networks and if we should assume that going forward from here, growth in net new mortgage lending in the U.K. would further accelerate. And the final question, also on the U.K., but here, on the current account side. It seems from what we read in the press that the current account offering at this point in time is very competitive in the U.K. And I was just wondering if you could share a bit of detail on this strategy there because looking at the latest account, it seems like that there's quite a substantial deposit overhang in the U.K. And I was just trying to get a sense on what the aim here is in terms of broadening the current account offering.\\nIain Mackay\\nSo I think if I take the last one first. You have seen again the deposit, the AD ratio, asset-deposit ratio sitting just below 68%. We saw significant customer deposit growth across each of our global businesses within 2016, most notably that was within Hong Kong, the wider Asia and the U.K. And so we've got our current accounts and overall savings proposition out there in the marketplace. Customers either like it because it has price or they like it because of the strength of the HSBC balance sheet and the overall security. I think if you were to dispose [ph] it there from a corporate perspective, it's probably the latter. And from a retail customer perspective, it's probably more difficult to point to any particular differentiation in that regard. If you think about overall deposit concentration, the greatest, the most significant deposit surplus that we carry is in Hong Kong. It is the most significant by a long stretch. It is then followed by strong deposit and AD ratios within the U.K. And then latterly, if you work down the list, you sort of come to the U.S. as sort of being third in terms of overall concentration of deposits that are either U.S. dollar directly or U.S. dollar linked. But Hong Kong is the big piece in that equation. I think in terms of mortgage growth in the U.K., there clearly was a focus in 2015 and '16 in terms of expanding our ability to access more of the market from -- in terms of being able to see more of the market in terms of accessing mortgage leads. But in terms of overall growth, it's actually been a fairly steady picture in terms of 2016 versus 2017 where we've grown at a reasonably steady pace from the first quarter of '16 through the second, third and fourth quarters. If you think about this at the beginning of the year, we had slightly less than $93 billion outstanding in U.K. mortgage balances. And at the end of the year, we had about $96 billion, and that's on a constant-currency basis. So overall, we grew the book, but I wouldn't have called it a headlong charge for growth, but there's a very strong balance between underwriting discipline and doing the right thing in terms of appropriate product for the customers in terms of the direction of the U.K. business.\\nMartin Leitgeb\\nAnd on the deposit denomination, is this roughly 50% of the -- what is reflected for the U.S. dollar, Hong Kong dollar exposure?\\nIain Mackay\\nWe'll come back to that. So like I said, the Hong Kong dollar deposits in terms of something linked to the U.S. dollar is the most significant surplus that we've got sitting around the world. I don't have the breakdown of the deposit base globally for the group by currency, but we can come back to you on that one.\\nOperator\\nNext question today comes from Jason Napier from UBS.\\nJason Napier\\nTwo on costs, please, and then one on capital. The sort of enlarged gross cost program and the breakdown of the sort of waterfall there, just wanted to ask again for a little bit more color on the inflation of your rate costs, that's well over $1 billion now versus the original plan. Is there some sense as to what has changed there? I appreciate the comments on taking it as OpEx. I'm just interested in the sort of -- in the way that things have turned out. And likewise, the very substantial increase in transformational savings that you're aiming for strips by division, where that is coming from given the size of the numbers. Secondly, a much easier one, the Corporate Centre costs x levy look reassuringly stable at about $250 million [ph] a quarter. I just wondered if that sort of an underlying $1 billion a year run rate for Corp Centre x levy was about right. And then I have a last question on capital.\\nIain Mackay\\nCan you give me the question on capital?\\nJason Napier\\nCertainly. So -- and I'm afraid I'm really just asking you to rehearse what I think you already said at Q3 around the change in treatment of BoCom. But if I think about some of the comments today, the buyback announced today takes you to 13.5% for CET1. The $8 billion of capital that you've mentioned, you said, is potentially excess in the U.S., it's another 100 basis points, and BoCom is worth a little over 100 in Q3. I'm just trying to understand again whether the sense from yourself is that the change in treatment at the PRA level is in the near term or in the medium term distributable, because that would imply a sort of a new running deck for capital requirement of 11.5%, which I think many investors might regard as too good to be true.\\nIain Mackay\\nSorry, can you grant your rationale for 11.5%? You're suggesting that an appropriate ratio for the group is 11.5% common equity tier 1?\\nJason Napier\\nWell, I'm just trying to check the math. So I think in a response to an earlier question, you said that you suggested that excess capital in the U.S. was $8 billion, so that's 100 basis points. The benefit in Q3 from the PRA has changed to the BoCom treatment was 104 basis points. So kind of where you are now net of those 2 things is 11.5%. And I was just -- wanted to get your sense as to -- yes?\\nIain Mackay\\nOne way to think about it, we've set out a common equity tier 1 ratio target of 12% to 13%. And I think for probably the last 12 to 18 months, we've been pretty clear that probably at the top end of that range is the appropriate place for us to be. Certainly, until some of the regulatory uncertainty that still persists is resolved in an appropriate manner, clearly, it's a little bit disappointing that we didn't get the final guidance on Basel III revisions or Basel IV in January. We'll hopefully get something on that later this year. But no, our common equity tier 1, sitting at 13.5% after this buyback, is 50 basis points above the top end of the range that we would target. So therefore, it kind of comes back to Stuart's comments, when we have capital resources at the group that are in excess of our common equity tier 1 ratio, there's a number of factors we'll consider. One, the investment opportunity at improved return levels within the group, the overall coverage for the dividend and then consider the opportunity for buyback. The other factors that clearly flow into that is where we are with respect to overall stability in the regulatory environment as it relates to capital resources and, more broadly, dealing with uncertainty from a geopolitical perspective and how that could impact the overall revenue and profit generation within the group. So there are -- it is a multifaceted problem that the industry faces, and I think we've got a pretty sensible and sound framework around dealing with that. But do not assume that moving significantly below 13% is something that we would countenance in the short, medium or long term.\\nJason Napier\\nThat's very clear.\\nIain Mackay\\nOkay. From a cost perspective, going to the overall compliance. So the overall regulatory and compliance costs were well beyond the Global Standards. The Global Standards is a significant component of that. And as Stuart pointed out, we continue to invest on delivering our commitments against the U.S. deferred prosecution agreement, the agreement with the Financial Conduct Authority in the U.K. And that is a level of investment that we would expect. And certainly, Colin Bell, who leads that overall focus for us, is firmly of the view that investment in that area will peak in 2017, and that's consistent with previous guidance that we provided in that regard. Other programs that flow into that, stress-testing, we do multiple stress tests around the world for regulators. We had over 60 stress tests last year informed by regulatory guidance. We have our own internal stress testing program that's been running for many years that really informs questions that Marc Moses, our Chief Risk Officer, Stuart, the board have that we stress test against. It also covers implementation of bidding transparency in the United Kingdom. It covers implementation of IFRS 9. It covers CCAR in the United States. So it's a broad base of programs that are dealt with in the regulatory and compliance space. Implementation of a senior manager resumed in the U.K. is another that falls into this area. The area of expanded investment is primarily within the Global Standards program as it relates to anti-money laundering and sanctions control and overall financial crime risk management, and we would expect that investment to peak in 2017. And as Stuart said, we would expect that to become part of the run rate. I think our view is that we will deliver our productivity over time, but we will deliver that productivity over the broader suite of regulatory compliance -- regulatory and compliance programs as opposed to specifically within the Global Standards program. In terms of what's really delivering the cost saves, it's across each of the global businesses focused both on front-office and back-office processes. There is some very significant contribution to the strong -- our technology and operations teams in terms of the efficiency with which our service centers around the world operate, loading and optimization of the workforce within those in terms of getting better efficiency in terms of responding to customer requirements, collection activities, for example. From a technology perspective, the overhaul that Andy Maguire and Darryl West have led across the organization is leading to some significant savings. One of the consequences that you saw from that was the impairment that we took in the fourth quarter against some of the software that we no longer deploy within the business. But it is really across every aspect of the business within the supporting functions, across risk, across finance, we've seen significant savings realized as we improved processes. And really, what we've seen, which has informed the increase of the targets, is not necessarily a proliferation of programs that we've got delivering those efficiencies, but getting greater yield from the programs that we've already launched. Clearly, there are more programs to be launched, but the main contributor is greater yields from programs that we've already had up and running and, frankly, getting better at this as time goes on. I think the other point to make here is this is not about getting at the end of '17, dropping the tools, taking a big rest, slurping back a glass of champagne and congratulating ourselves; but it's about counting that productivity into 2018 and beyond.\\nJason Napier\\nAnd then the last one was Corporate Centre x levy, about $1 billion a year, that feels like a sort of stable-ish number, does it? Or [indiscernible] to the new divisions?\\nIain Mackay\\nIt's not a bad number for '17. But just as the rest of the business is focused on delivering cost savings and better processes, our Corporate Centre is focused on the same thing. So it's not a bad number, but we'll be working on -- we'll be focused on trying to work down a little bit in this cycle as well.\\nDouglas Flint\\nWe've got time for one last question.\\nOperator\\nWe will take our last question today from Stephen Andrews from Deutsche Bank.\\nStephen Andrews\\nJust comes back to that last question on Slide 7 on the Corporate Centre and that $1 billion for the year x levy. Can you just make a comment on the bank levy? I mean, it came in a little bit lower than expectation. You said there was a write-back. What you would expect that to be this year, because I think it was about $300 million better than people's expectations.\\nIain Mackay\\nYes. So the rate dropped. So you'll recall from the budget in 2015, I think, the rate will drop each year from now to 2021 when the basis of assessment will go from the consolidated balance sheet of the group to the U.K. balance sheet of the group. And it is in 2021 when we will realize a significant reduction in the bank levy, assuming that, that budget undertaking in legislation remains in place. What you should expect between now and 2020 is somewhere in the range of $1 billion to $1.1 billion each year for the bank levy.\\nStephen Andrews\\nSo net of the bank levy, we should just really be running that Corporate Centre forward to 0 because it looks like a lot of TLAC costs, the roll-off costs now of the U.S. CML, all of this in that Corporate Centre with the new breakdown, is that correct? So do you think about any contribution at all from the Corporate Centre, which has been positive in the past?\\nIain Mackay\\nI'm sorry, when you say positive, what do you mean?\\nStephen Andrews\\nWell, if you -- if I go to Slide 7 and look at the sort of underlying run rates you're giving on the businesses, you've got the global businesses and the Corporate Centre. And the Corporate Centre, as you rightly pointed out in your comments, is the minus $621 million in the last quarter which was the debt issue.\\nIain Mackay\\nYes.\\nStephen Andrews\\nIf I'm right, what you were saying just now with the previous question was that we're looking about $1 billion, that running at $1 billion for the full year x the levy? Because there was just a lot more drag on that going forward, as you've pointed out. So if you're saying $1 billion for the full year, we take off the $1.1 billion, essentially for the full year, we should be pretty much forecasting that as 0 for the full year at each quarter. I know you don't give forecast, but how we should think about it?\\nIain Mackay\\nSo from an x levy perspective?\\nStephen Andrews\\nYes, no, including levy full year, roughly 0.\\nIain Mackay\\nWell, but remember what's going through the Corporate Centre here. You've got the associates, you've got BoCom, you've got Saudi British Bank, you've got headquarter operating expenses, you've got the net of our corporate -- our global service centers, revenue and expenses coming through that, you've got a proportion of the TLAC cost coming through that, some of which clearly has pushed down to the operating entities as we preposition that. So there are still -- clearly, there's very active tools coming through the Corporate Centre. I mean, x levy, I think the better analysis is the x levy is, from an operating expense perspective, subject to comments I made, is probably $1 billion.\\nStephen Andrews\\nX levy, okay. So including levy, okay.\\nIain Mackay\\nOkay?\\nStephen Andrews\\nYes.\\nDouglas Flint\\nOkay. Thanks, everyone.\\nStuart Gulliver\\nThank you very much.\\nIain Mackay\\nThank you.\\nOperator\\nThank you, ladies and gentlemen, that concludes the call for the HSBC Holdings plc's Annual Results 2016.

For your information, this conference is being recorded.\\nAt this time, I will hand the call over to your host, Mr. Stuart Gulliver, Group Chief Executive.\\nStuart Gulliver\\nThanks very much. So good afternoon from Hong Kong; good morning to everyone in London, and welcome to our first quarter results call. With me today is Iain, who's going to talk through the detailed financial performance. We'll both then take questions, but I'll start by pulling out a few highlights.\\nOur first quarter performance was resilient in market conditions that challenged the entire banking industry. Against the very strong first quarter of 2015, profits were down, although we increased market share in many of the product areas that are critical to our strategy. Market uncertainty led to extreme levels of volatility in January and February, which affected our ability to generate revenue in our Markets and Wealth Management businesses. Both businesses recovered well in March.\\nOur diversified universal banking business model helped to cushion the impact through growth in other parts of the bank. Commercial Banking continued its momentum in spite of the slowdown in global trade, and we increased market share across our strategic trade corridors. We also grew revenue elsewhere in Retail Banking and Wealth Management, particularly current accounts and savings in Hong Kong and the U.K., and personal lending in Asia and Mexico.\\nA combination of tight cost management and the increasing impact of our cost savings programs reduced operating expenses compared to the fourth quarter and kept them broadly unchanged compared to the first quarter of 2015. Loan impairment charges were down by $450 million compared to the fourth quarter and up by $692 million compared to the first quarter of 2015.\\nWe maintained a strong common equity Tier 1 ratio of 11.9%, adding $800 million to capital, net of dividends. We also maintained a strong leverage ratio of 5%. In March, we sold $10.5 billion equivalent of TLAC securities in U.S. dollars and euros across 5 separate tranches in a range of maturities in both fixed and floating format. Our order books were well oversubscribed, in spite of market volatility and difficult new issue conditions, with demand from an extremely broad range of investors. This was the largest senior unsecured fundraising by banks since 2008, and it reopened the benchmark wholesale funding markets for U.K. and European bank holding companies. Our targeted initiatives removed another $15 billion of risk-weighted assets in the first quarter. The risk-weighted assets increased overall due to an increase in corporate lending. There were also higher market volatility, and some corporate credit downgrades also increased risk-weighted assets. We remain on track to hit our risk-weighted asset reduction target.\\nThe technical body of the Brazilian competition agency has now recommended to its board that the sale of our Brazil business be approved. We await a final decision from the competition agency. This is the final regulatory approval required prior to the completion of the transaction. Completing the transaction will add approximately 60 basis points to our common equity Tier 1 ratio.\\nOur Asian businesses continued to gain momentum. We made important market share gains in debt capital markets, China M&A and syndicated lending. We also had strong business wins on the back of our increased investment in Asia, and we extended our leadership in services related to renminbi internationalization.\\nIain is going to now take you through the numbers.\\nIain Mackay\\nThanks, Stuart. Looking quickly at some key metrics for first quarter. The reported return on average ordinary shareholders' equity was 9%. The reported return on average tangible equity was 10.3%; and on an adjusted basis, we had a negative jaws of 2.8%. The movement in jaws was mainly due to a 3.8% decline in adjusted revenue, which exceeded a 1% fall in adjusted costs.\\nThis next slide takes us from reported to adjusted. Reported profit before tax of $6.1 billion for the first quarter included a $1.2 billion gain for fair value on our own debt relating to credit spread and $479 million of other significant items. Allowing for these items leaves an adjusted profit before tax of $5.4 billion for the first quarter. You'll find more details on these adjustments in the appendix. And we'll focus on adjusted numbers for the remainder of this presentation.\\nThis next slide shows a comparison with the fourth quarter of 2015. Adjusted profit before tax was $3.6 billion higher than the fourth quarter due to higher revenue, lower loan impairment charges and costs. You'll recall that the bank levy influences the fourth quarter numbers. Excluding the bank levy, operating expenses fell by $236 million. Loan impairment charges were $450 million lower, mainly in Commercial Banking. The fourth quarter included an increase in specific loan impairment charges in a small number of countries, which largely affected local factors and collective charges relating to oil and gas.\\nSlide 6 breaks down adjusted profit by global business and geography on a period-by-period basis. These profits were achieved in challenging market conditions and relative to a very strong first quarter last year. The main business drivers of the reduction in profit were lower revenue in Global Banking and Markets and Retail Banking and Wealth Management. An increased loan impairment charges in the Global Banking and Markets principally related to oil and gas and metals and mining.\\nWe've split out Brazil from the rest of the group here to show the impact that it had on our numbers in the first quarter. This also gives you a basis for comparison from when Brazil drops out of our numbers following completion of the transaction. We expect this would have positive impact on operating expenses, loan impairment charges and capital.\\nSlide 7 shows an analysis of revenue. As Stuart said earlier, conditions in the first 2 months of the year were difficult, particularly in our Markets business and Wealth Management. There was a clear improvement in March, however, and that continued into April. You'll recall that our performance in the first quarter of 2015 included the positive impact of the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect; and the strong renminbi market, which benefited us more than most. It's worth noting that our revenues are down no more than the industry average in spite of this.\\nIn Principal Retail Banking and Wealth Management, revenue was $270 million or 5% lower than the first quarter of 2015. This was mainly in Wealth Management, caused by the impact of adverse movements in interest rates in equity markets and life insurance as well as lower customer activity. We did, however, grow revenue from customer accounts in Hong Kong and the U.K. and from higher personal lending in Latin America and Asia.\\nCommercial Banking revenue continued to grow, driven by higher average balances in Payments and Cash Management and further loan growth. Client-facing global banks and markets revenue was down by $286 million or 7% compared to a strong performance in the prior year. In common with the rest of the banking industry, extreme levels of market volatility led to reduced client activity in our markets business, particularly in equities and credit and foreign exchange. Revenue was up in rates. There was a $172 million reduction in revenue from Balance Sheet Management due in large part to lower gains on disposal of available-for-sale securities. Global Private Banking revenue is down by $87 million or 15% due to lower brokerage and trading activity in Europe and Asia. However, we attracted $4 billion of net new money in the quarter.\\nOther provided $179 million of revenue in the first quarter. This included favorable fair value movements associated with long-term debt issued by HSBC Holdings. These are related to interest and exchange rate risk but not our own credit spread, which we excluded from adjusted performance. In last year's first quarter, Other had losses of $200 million, mainly from the adverse impact of certain intra-group adjustments. This means that revenue for Other was up by $379 million on a quarter-by-quarter basis.\\nLoan impairment charges were $692 million higher than the first quarter of 2015 but $450 million lower than the fourth quarter. $159 million of the increase on the first quarter of 2015 came specifically from Brazil due to difficult economic and trading conditions. These were mostly collectively assessed impairments in Retail Banking and Wealth Management.\\nThe increase also includes an adjustment of around $100 million in our U.S. runoff portfolio. Charges in wholesale were up by $380 million. Q1 included additional specific charges related to oil and gas, mainly in the U.S. and Canada. There was also a charge in Australia relating to metals and mining as well as higher specific charges in a small number of countries. As the chart shows, the level of loans reported as past due but not impaired continues to reflect our risk management. And as we said at our annual results, we continue to monitor oil and gas sector closely and to manage our exposures accordingly. There's a detailed overview of our oil and gas and metals and mining exposure in the appendix.\\nAdjusted operating expenses were $76 million or 1% lower than the first quarter of 2015. Excluding bank levy adjustments in each period, we were successful in keeping costs broadly unchanged in spite of the effects of inflation and $743 million of investment in regulatory programs and compliance.\\nThis investment reflected the continued implementation of our Global Standards program and other requirements. And as we said in June, we expect this investment to continue throughout 2016 and to flatten in 2017 as increased automation and process improvements take effect.\\nYou'll recall that our cost savings program is designed to cover the cost of investments in Global Standards, investment in growth and the impact of inflation as well as to achieve an exit rate equivalent to 2014 by the end of 2017.\\nIn Commercial Banking, our cost reduction initiatives neutralized the effect of both inflation and increased investment in Global Standards. These included our simplified organization structure and process optimization within our lending, onboarding and servicing platforms.\\nCosts were down marginally in Retail Bank Wealth Management as investments in our Asia branch network and inflationary pressures were more than offset by cost savings, including our digital transformation and branch optimization programs. Costs fell in Global Banking and Markets due primarily to lower staff performance costs in Asia, Europe and the United States.\\nThis continues the good start that we made to our cost saving program, and we remain confident of hitting our cost target. Rebased for currency translation and the sale of Brazil, that target is now $29.1 billion.\\nTurning to capital. The group's common equity Tier 1 ratio was maintained at 11.9%. We increased common equity Tier 1 capital by $2 billion in the first quarter. This was from capital generation through profits, net of dividends, of around $800 million. And we benefited from favorable foreign currency translation differences of $1 billion. While total risk-weighted assets increased in the first quarter, we continued to make progress with our risk-weighted assets initiatives. The next slide sets out the movements in more detail.\\nThe increase in risk-weighted assets in the first quarter was a result of book size and quality. Growth in book size was mainly driven by 2 things: increased corporate lending, mainly in Commercial Banking and Global Banking and Markets; and increased market volatility and client activity, impacting counterparty credit risk and market risk. Each of these accounted for around half of the movement in book size. Book quality represents risk-weighted asset movements due to changes in the underlying credit quality of our customers.\\nThese movements were partially offset by the -- by our continued progress in RWA initiatives. Our investor -- at our investor update in 2015, we set a target to reduce group's risk-weighted assets by $290 billion by the end of 2017. The chart on the top right of the page shows this target adjusted for the latest foreign exchange rates. This gives a rebased target of $279 billion. Since the start of 2015, we've reduced risk-weighted assets by $139 billion, of which $15 billion was in the first quarter of this year. These reductions include legacy credit and U.S. runoff portfolios. Our risk-weighted asset reduction plans are on track, and we remain confident of hitting our targets by the end of 2017.\\nThe reported return on risk-weighted assets was 2.2% compared to 2.4% in the first quarter of 2015. We continue to work towards an adjusted return on risk-weighted assets of greater than 2.3% by 2017.\\nI'll now hand back to Stuart.\\nStuart Gulliver\\nThank you. This slide provides a summary of our progress in the 11 months since our investor update. Iain has already talked about risk-weighted assets and I've already talked about Brazil, so I'm going to concentrate on the other actions here.\\nOur U.S. and Mexico businesses are heading in the right direction. Adjusted profits in our principal U.S. business grew by 29% to $181 million largely due to lower operating expenses. Revenue was up by another 4%. And we've continued to make solid progress in running down our U.S. CML legacy portfolio, including the disposal of a $1.4 billion tranche in April.\\nIn Mexico, adjusted profit before tax of $72 million was up 104% on the first quarter of 2015. This was due to higher lending balances in Retail Banking and Wealth Management, higher insurance revenues and improved collaboration between Retail Banking and Wealth Management and Commercial Banking. We're also gaining good traction in terms of cross-border business in the area recovered by NAFTA. We have double-digit growth in Commercial Banking across the free trade zone, and we're currently winning around 3 out of 4 cross-border deals in the region.\\nAs Iain has already said, we've made good progress in operating expenses while continuing to invest in growth initiatives and regulatory programs and compliance.\\nAll of our cost programs are now underway. We have reduced employee numbers by around 6,000 since the first quarter of last year. And the sale of Brazil will reduce FTEs by a further 19,000 to bring the group total to 235,000. This compares with 295,000 on the 31st December 2010. As this trend illustrates, we've got a good grip on costs. Although progress will not be linear, we're confident of hitting our target by the end of 2017.\\nOur Payments and Cash Management business maintained its strong momentum with an increase of 7% on the first quarter of last year. And Global Trade and Receivables Finance maintained its position in a slow trade environment and captured additional market share across our top 23 strategic corridors. In the first quarter, we also received clearance to offer our own credit cards in mainland China.\\nAdjusted profit before tax was $357 million in ASEAN, which was up 14% due to lower LICs and lower costs. We have also increased assets under management in Asia by 10% in the first quarter and grew revenue from insurance manufacturing new business premiums in Asia by 18% to around USD 600 million. Revenue from renminbi internationalization was down, but we have strengthened our leadership position in the quarter. I'll talk more about this on the next slide.\\nSlide 14 shows the numbers behind the story. We've increased our market shares across a number of product lines, as we've invested in the business and as competitors have withdrawn from some of our core markets. In the first quarter, we held our share of the market in Global Trade and Receivables Finance but increased our market share in 4 out of 5 regions in documentary trade. We also strengthened our leadership position in Payments and Cash Management. We are a market leader in Asia advisory business and have strengthened that position considerably. We're the established #1 underwriter in debt capital markets, and we've retained our #1 ranking for syndicated loans in Hong Kong and Mainland China and further increased our market share there. We've also dramatically increased our share of the Asian M&A market.\\nFinally, we've retained our #1 position in the league tables for offshore renminbi bonds and have a 52% share of the Securities Services RQFII market. This puts us in an excellent position not just to benefit from a more stable renminbi market, but from the relaxation of investment barriers for onshore bonds and the likely rollout of the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect later this year. No other bank is in this strong position to capitalize on these opportunities.\\nIn summary, we've shown resilience and made further progress towards the completion of our strategic actions. We intend to keep reporting on this progress on a quarterly basis.\\nThe market volatility that affected the first 2 months of the year has largely stabilized. March was a better month than both January and February, and April has continued in broadly the same vein. Despite the difficult conditions, our diversified and balanced business has enabled us to continue to generate growth and to capture market share where possible.\\nThere continues to be plenty of revenue opportunities available to us in the coming quarters, particularly in the areas that we are targeting for growth. The planned Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect and the opening up of the China interbank bond market will enable us to capitalize on our market access in Asia. The increase in Chinese ODI and M&A involving Chinese firms plays to our leadership of the Asian advisory market. And the rollout of the Belt and Road initiative and the growth of green finance will create opportunities in infrastructure finance and green bonds, both of which are already significant areas of strength for HSBC.\\nWe are confident of achieving our target of $4.5 billion to $5 billion of cost savings by the end of 2017. And our strong balance sheet gives us the latitude to manage the business for the long term in accordance with our strategy.\\nWe'll now take questions. The operator will explain the procedure and then introduce the first question. Operator?\\nOperator\\n[Operator Instructions] We will now take our first question today from Alastair Ryan from Bank of America.\\nAlastair Ryan\\nTwo from me, please. First, the net interest margin sounds like it's stabilizing underlying in the quarter but down a bit on a reported basis. Ex Brazil, now that the feds started hiking rates, if only a little, can you give us any sense of whether you've hit the bottom on the margin? There's been a sort of a long downdraft. Has rate hit 0? And second, on trade, you sound a bit more downbeat in the text but a bit more positive on this call. Can you give us a sense where you think your trade revenues are headed across volumes and margins, please?\\nIain Mackay\\nYes, on net interest margin, Alastair, very, very stable compared to the fourth quarter of last year. And I think that can be true really across all of the main product lines with respect to NIMs. I think going forward one of the things that will create a little bit of pressure on NIM at a group level is the cost of TLAC. And we talked about that at the end of the year and going forward, but when you look at it on a trading basis, the net interest margin has been very stable in the fourth quarter. And certainly, there were no indications of particular pressure coming through beyond some of the factors that we talked about a few weeks ago when we released the full year numbers, so very consistent.\\nStuart Gulliver\\nSo going on trade. So the overall macro backdrop, as you know, is that trade growth was very sluggish, with about 2.8% growth for last year, in 2015, and actually quite a sharp decline in the value of trade by about 13%. Those are overall WTO numbers. What we've seen within our business is that growth in trade within Global Banking and Markets, where revenue is up about 3%; and a decline in CMB, where revenue was down about 6%. But if you dig into it, there's a decline in documentary trade balances, which are down about 13%, but actually structured trade finance, receivables finance is up about 15%. Now actually, that's longer-term positive for margins because documentary credits have been extremely competitive with very, very tight margins. So as the market moves towards structured trade and receivables finance, that actually should offer some revenue growth. As it stands, we've grown market share. The HKMA data here suggests that the overall market for trade balances, this is February '16 Hong Kong Monetary Authority number, was down about 34% in Hong Kong. And we're down about 9% in Hong Kong, which indicates that we've taken market share. So to be honest, we are slightly more positive than perhaps the text suggests, but it's a complicated picture. But what we can see is that we're outperforming the overall market across all 23 of our strategic trade corridors, and our declines are considerably less than the market is showing. And there's a switch from documentary credits towards structured trade, which itself has better margins.\\nOperator\\nOur next question today comes from Raul Sinha from JPMorgan.\\nRaul Sinha\\nStuart, Iain, can I have a couple of questions, please, for the revenues? The first one is on Page 20 of your release, where you talk about Principal RBWM. And I particularly wanted to focus on wealth products, where you obviously had $1.2 billion of top line this quarter. And that was one of the areas which was impacted by the volatility. But if you look at your -- the comps against last year, for example, last year, you had $1.9 billion of revenues in this business in the second quarter, presumably helped by the China bull market. So I was just wondering if you can talk a little bit about the outlook for this business, what -- how would you characterize your performance in the first quarter here? And how should we expect this to move going forward?\\nIain Mackay\\nYes, Raul, I think one of the things to bear in mind about the first quarter of last year was an incredibly strong performance coming through in the back of the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect, which represent a significant uplift to revenues coming through retail bank Wealth Management in the Asian market, specifically Wealth Management. The other feature that, again, added a somewhat positive effect overall on PVIF coming through in the first quarter of last year, we saw almost the exact opposite in the first quarter of 2016. And when you look at the overall impact on retail bank Wealth Management revenues, that's really what it boils down to; is a -- market updates coming through PVIF in the insurance manufacturing businesses, and that is mostly within Hong Kong and France; and then the impact of lower brokerage revenues. When you look at the performance coming through, if you like, the installed base of current accounts, deposit accounts, mortgages, unsecured personal lending, overall the outlook remains fairly stable across each of the major markets for us. The U.K. has been reasonably positive for us in the first quarter. Hong Kong, for fairly obvious reasons, has been a little bit slower, but the main drivers of the lower revenues have been the 2 features and the comparison to first quarter of last year.\\nStuart Gulliver\\nIt's worth bearing in mind that it's a combination of Retail Banking and Wealth Management, as the name suggests. So the Wealth Management piece, as Iain's just outlined, is kind of weak because we had such a strong first and second quarter of last year, but actually, we've got good growth in current accounts and savings and in personal lending. So if you look at the Retail Banking piece, current account, savings and deposits, if you're on Page 20, you can see growth. And you can also see growth in the personal lending piece. So actually, it's not an -- it's not just the Wealth Management business. It's both the Retail Banking, i.e. deposits and loans; as well as the Wealth Management piece. Your second question, Raul?\\nRaul Sinha\\nOkay. And then just on that sort of leading into the jaws and your outlook for positive jaws for this year. Obviously, costs down 2% ex the investment in reg spend and the levy credit, and revs down 4% underlying. I guess you probably want to narrow and turn that round as the year progresses, but I suspect you'd probably need a little bit of help from the revenue environment. Or is there something that I'm missing in terms of costs that we should expect the cost momentum to build as we move through the year?\\nIain Mackay\\nI think a little bit of help on the revenue line would certainly be appreciated. The focus on the costs is to hit the $4.5 billion to $5 billion of cost take-outs by the end of 2017 such that we get that 2014 run rate. There's good traction around that. We've got all the programs up and running, so the focus is very much in making sure that we can stay on top of and execute against the things we control. That being said, within the revenue space, a little bit of help would be appreciated, but again, I think if you look at the underlying development of Commercial Banking, in the first quarter, it was reasonably encouraging when you consider the underlying trading conditions. Overall, looking at Global Banking and Markets, excluding Balance Sheet Management, down 7%, which I think is a bit of a standout on an industry comparison perspective. And we clearly saw some of the stabilization coming through in our March revenues, and that has been broadly sustained through April. And then retail bank Wealth Management, again there's a very strong focus from John and the team in terms of, one, executing against the -- their share of the $4.5 billion to $5 billion in terms of managing the overall cost equation; and also, obviously, a focus on continuing to build the customer relationships that support revenue. So we're not necessarily depending on a significant upgrade in rates, but clearly, a slightly more stable, less-volatile environment coming out of the first quarter into second will, hopefully, be helpful.\\nOperator\\nOur next question today comes from the line of Chira Barua from Bernstein.\\nChirantan Barua\\nJust a quick one on Hong Kong. I've been following this for a long time. This is the first quarter after ages that I've seen Hong Kong loan growth down across retail, commercial, global markets, Private Banking sequentially, so it will be great to get some color on what's happening. Stuart, your comments on trade, very helpful; the same on the retail side or the commercial side in terms of growth. What are the dependencies into, not only this quarter, this year going forward would be much appreciated.\\nIain Mackay\\nI think there's probably not a great deal that we can add, Chira, on top of what we've answered the last couple of questions here. I think what we saw, certainly within the retail bank Wealth Management space in Hong Kong, was a growth in current accounts. And one suspects that that's a feature of many of our customers sitting in the sideline, waiting to see slightly more stable environment for investing, which certainly should help support the Wealth Management revenue equation going forward in slightly more stable markets. So that's certainly an expectation that we'd like to see. Overall, Commercial Banking continues to perform reasonably well. And Global Banking and Markets in Asia was afflicted with the same sort of underlying trends that we saw coming through our European and U.S. business. And improvements that we've seen coming through March and April in that regard, again, are somewhat encouraging. And it can -- it goes without saying that Peter and the team in Asia are -- continue to be very closely focused on the overall cost management picture. Also, we do have a very robust 39% cost efficiency ratio within the Hong Kong market. I think the overall -- the other thing that's worth mentioning is that within our ASEAN markets, we saw an improvement in PBT over the course of the first quarter, with lower loan impairment charges and good cost control across the businesses and reasonably constructive revenue environment. So notwithstanding the fact that Hong Kong is hugely important, there is more than just one arrow in the quiver on this front.\\nOperator\\nOur next question today comes from David Lock from Deutsche Bank.\\nDavid Lock\\nThree quick ones from me, please. First of all, on rates. It looks like you had a very strong performance in the quarter; about 20% up. I just wondered, within the context of your commentary about the first 2 months of the year being a bit weaker and the third month being a bit better and that continuing, if you'd give a little bit of color about that rates performance. Should we expect that to be sustained into the second quarter? Second question is on costs to achieve. I think, so far, you've taken about $1.3 billion since the beginning of 2015, so probably a little bit behind the $4 billion to $4.5 billion run rate. So I just wondered if you could update us on the phasing of that and when we might expect that to flow through. And then thirdly, on GBM Balance Sheet Management. I think, in the past, you've given us a little guidance on how we should expect that to evolve over the course of the year. I just wondered if you had any views at the first quarter on what we might expect for BSM this year.\\nStuart Gulliver\\nSo Balance Sheet Management, about $2.5 billion. Rates, no, I don't think you can extrapolate that forward. What I think you can more look at is the recovery in foreign exchange, credit and equities. Remember total client-facing Global Banking and Markets revenues were only down 7%, which actually, as Iain was saying earlier, compared to most of the industry, was a very strong performance. Our GBM business, as we've been saying kind of repeatedly for a very long term, has a kind of different mixture. If you add in Balance Sheet Management, the overall adjusted revenues for the business are down 12%. I don't think that you should be assuming a continued outperformance from rates but more that in March and April, more normalized trading conditions return, so helping the foreign exchange and equity piece more.\\nIain Mackay\\nOn CTA, David, I wouldn't necessarily expect absolute linearity into -- coming through the cost to achieve; just as we've talked about, not -- hopefully, not anticipating exact linearity coming through in the actual costs being realized. What I would say is that normally, on the basis that we're going to recognize our $4.5 billion to $5 billion of saves by the end of 2017, you can expect the cost to achieve to come through slightly ahead in terms of the actual cost savings. So we're about 1 -- just over $1.2 billion since inception through to the current point. And there is -- I think Stuart mentioned it in his comments, all of the programs and projects that we've got focused on realizing cost saves are up now and -- are up and running now, and as a consequence of which, we'll continue to see the cost to achieve coming through over the course of the coming quarters.\\nOperator\\nOur next question today comes from Tom Rayner from Exane.\\nThomas Rayner\\nCan I have 2 questions, please? First, to just go back to Hong Kong, see if I can get any more out of you. I mean it accounted for about 38% of group profit in the first quarter. The loan book looks like it's contracted, annualized, 13% in Q1, commercial itself down 20% on an annualized run rate, so either something has happened in the first quarter to explain that or it looks like a fairly big sort of retrenching in terms of your sort of appetite to lend. I noticed the loan-to-deposit ratio has fallen from 56% a year ago to about 48% now. So I just wondered if I could push you a bit more for some comments on what's happening in Hong Kong specifically. And I have a second question, on Slide 11, which is the RWA slide. I don't know if you want that now or to take it separately.\\nIain Mackay\\nHang on, Tom. On Tom, we -- on Hong Kong, we had a number of large corporate repayments in the first quarter of the year. I think the other thing that would have characterized the first quarter was relatively low demand for credits. And I think, again, that kind of goes to some of the things we've already talked about with respect to retail bank Wealth Management as well as Global Banking and Markets. But the main feature that we saw in terms of really impacting balance sheet was a little bit of corporate repayment coming through the first quarter and lower demand. It certainly wasn't specifically as a consequence of a reduction in risk appetite from the Asian businesses perspective. We also saw slightly lower mortgages. As you've seen coming through a lot of the media coverage, there's an expectation of declining property prices within the Hong Kong environment. And again, just a little bit of risk aversion with respect to part of our customers waiting to see if the environment settles down is probably the best way to characterize that at the moment, Tom.\\nStuart Gulliver\\nAnd another thing, Tom, that you'd have had in the first quarter of 2015, which is related to -- and in the second quarter of 2015, which is related to Hong Kong-Shanghai Stock Connect, is actually quite a lot of margin lending against equities, which clearly wasn't repeated in the first quarter of this year, which also would explain a chunk of the reduction in loans and advances.\\nThomas Rayner\\nSure. Okay, so when you sort of strip through all of that, I mean, are you looking at a reasonably stable loan book, do you think; or a small contraction or small growth? What's your sort of gut feel for the true underlying sort of business that is...\\nStuart Gulliver\\nI think, flat, to be honest, Tom, flat. Flat.\\nThomas Rayner\\nFlattish, yes, okay. Okay. Slide 11, I just wonder if you could add a bit more color to some of the big moving parts in reconciling the RWA movements. I know there's some explanation in the text. The increase due to book size, given again little real growth in the loan book, looks quite large. And then there's possibly the corporate downgrades driving the quality. Is there anything else you can add to what's going on to give us a feel for what we should be thinking about for the rest of the year on some of those drivers, please?\\nIain Mackay\\nIn terms of book size, Tom, there was about 50% of that came from actually growing lending. And that's made up across the north -- well, the U.S., in the U.K. and in Mexico were the main drivers in terms of growth coming through from a book size perspective. And then what you also have is obviously some step-up in market risk -- risk-weighted assets coming through, some of the volatility that we saw in the first quarter reflected at VaR and stressed VaR and then counterparty credit risk. That's really what we saw going on. So of that $16 billion book size, about 50-50 was split between actual growth in credits and lending to customers and then market volatility effects coming through, principally market risk and counterparty credit risk. And then book quality was really a reflection of the downgrades that we saw happening across both the oil and gas sector and the metals and mining sector principally, which again, when you look at the external factors, you would generally have expected to that -- to see that coming through.\\nThomas Rayner\\nSo if I -- is it fair to say then, if I'm thinking about going forward, the $9 billion of book quality won't necessarily repeat; and half of that increase in book size is volatility which might reverse, might get worse but it's not something which you should expect quarter in, quarter out?\\nIain Mackay\\nNo. I think it is that the aspect of market volatility is going to be driven by exactly that, but there's not necessarily an expectation of repetition around that. I think one of the other things that you need to bear in mind when you're looking at the balance sheet, Tom, is that, in the first quarter, we transferred almost $6 billion out of loans and advances to customers or held for sale, and that came out of our legacy book in Global Banking and Markets and out of our run-off CML portfolio. The majority of that, the vast majority, 80% of it, coming out of the CML portfolio in the U.S.\\nOperator\\nOur next question today comes from Rohith Chandra-Rajan from Barclays.\\nRohith Chandra-Rajan\\nA couple, if I could, please. The first one, just on costs. Obviously, good performance there, helping to offset some of the revenue pressures. Just wondering on the sort of $7.5 billion underlying costs, how feasible that is to hold that relatively flat throughout the rest of the year. Obviously, you've got the bank levy in the fourth quarter, but at the moment, you're being able to offset the regulatory spend and inflation through ongoing cost reductions. So just a comment on how you see that progressing through the year. And then just on the RWA side of things, you highlight that you're halfway through the reduction plan. Could you just give us some insight as to what you expect for the rest of the year? And then secondly, also on timing of Brazil, I mean it sounds like you're now quite close to that being finalized. Is the middle of the year realistic? And can you remind us on the RWA reduction there, please?\\nIain Mackay\\nYes, on Brazil, I think we're looking to -- our expectation is that we'll close in the first half of the year, so by the time we speak to you next, hopefully, we will have that transaction closed and the benefits coming through both the P&L and capital. And that's really one of the reasons that we provided a little bit more insight on the impact on the Brazilian numbers in the overall group so that you can track it through each of the 4 quarters this year. In terms of the RWA reduction, I think it was about $30 billion, if I remember correctly. We'll dig that one out for you. And then in terms of impact on capital overall, it's about 60 basis points. On RWA -- sorry, it was $37 billion coming through the risk-weighted assets on the disposal of Brazil. In terms of progress in RWAs for the remainder of the year, I'd probably sum it up in one word: progress. $15 billion in the first quarter. Obviously, we've made good progress, as Stuart mentioned, in terms of getting more out of the CML portfolio in the month of April. And as I just mentioned, we've transferred a substantial additional balance to held for sale out of the CML book. And that continues at pace. The U.S. team has done a great job there. And we'll continue to make progress with the Global Banking and Markets business, both in terms of legacy portfolio as well as just continued improved management of the capital efficiency across the various models that we've got and the customer base that we've got in RWAs. But as I mentioned, it's not something that we are planning from a linear perspective.\\nStuart Gulliver\\nYes, look, it's not linear, but if you just look at some stats: Global Banking and Markets has achieved 60% of its target already, so $84 billion out of a $141 billion target; CMB, 85% of its target has been achieved, so $25.4 billion out of $30 billion; and the U.S. CMLs, 43% of its 2015 to '17 target achieved. So as Iain says, this is not going to be equal parts month by month, but this is a huge focus.\\nIain Mackay\\nAnd on the costs, Rohith, we will -- we did not actually expect to keep costs flat over the remainder of the year. I think clearly what you saw in the first quarter in terms of Global Banking and Markets, our costs are managed there, certainly in line with overall revenues when it comes to the performance. The performance cost for employees, if the revenue doesn't come through, then the accrual for bonus doesn't come through with it. But broadly speaking, as we talked about back in June of last year and again today, we continue to invest significantly in Global Standards and wider regulatory programs. There's an investment cycle which would provide a little bit more detail about back last June, and we expect that investment cycle to continue through 2016 and really only start to realize significant benefits in terms of lower costs in that particular space as we work through 2017. So we feel there was great progress made in the first quarter of 2016. We do have investment programs that we need to continue through the remainder of '16. And that will put some upward pressure on the overall cost base for the remainder of this year.\\nRohith Chandra-Rajan\\nSo just on that, Iain, sorry. So the regulatory program and compliance costs of $0.7 billion in the quarter, you'd expect to trend up a bit from here. Is that what you're saying?\\nIain Mackay\\nWe do as that investment continues apace. And most of the investment is focused around the deployment of technology and automation into the countries in which we operate today. And as we get to that point, then the overall cost of compliance, we expect to be much more manageable; and possibly to see marginal, but only marginal reductions in the overall costs associated with that. But the investment cycle continues through '16, and we'll start to realize the benefits of that in '17.\\nOperator\\nOur next question today comes from Manus Costello from Autonomous.\\nManus Costello\\nI had a question about your AT1 issuance, please. There was a report in the press last week that the regulator had asked you to issue and you had politely declined. I wondered if you wanted to comment on that incident and more generally comment on what your calendar is like for issuing AT1. Because you've obviously still got a reasonable amount to issue before you hit your target.\\nIain Mackay\\nWell, first of all, I'd say don't believe everything you read in the FT. A fairest point would be a misquoted in an off-the-record conversation. Our regulator did not specifically request us to make issuance into the market, although a number of our investors did. I can well imagine the motivation behind that considering the higher premiums that have been associated with those kinds of issuances back in January and February. Insofar as our AT1 calendar goes, we would expect -- provided pricing is reasonably good, which it actually is at this precise moment in time, we would expect to be out in the market this quarter for AT1s, Tier 2s and other TLAC qualifying securities. We got $10.5 billion out in the first quarter at slightly higher sort of spreads than we would necessarily have liked, but they came in quite nicely at the end of February and into March. So we got $10.5 billion out. And certainly, in terms of volume of issuance through the second quarter, it would be similar or possibly slightly more in the second quarter. When you think overall at our program of issuance, we've got, over the next 3 years, about $50 billion of maturity coming through for refinancing. And then on top of that, we've got somewhere between $10 billion and $30 billion of new issuance to do to ensure that we meet the overall TLAC requirements by the beginning of 2019. And clearly, our view is to try and get as much of a jump on that in 2016 as we can provided the market conditions are reasonably supportive of that.\\nManus Costello\\nAnd when you talked earlier, Iain, about the pressure on the net interest margin from that coming through, are you implying that should start from kind of Q2 as that $10 billion starts to bite?\\nIain Mackay\\nWell, we've put $10.5 billion out. And we'll be paying the coupons on that as time passes, Manus, so yes, the cost of issuing that paper, which, as we've described in numerous occasions before, is surplus to our requirements, will create a little bit of pressure on the NIM.\\nOperator\\nOur next question today comes from Martin Leitgeb from Goldman Sachs.\\nMartin Leitgeb\\nJust a few follow-up question on revenues, please. And your comments obviously on Hong Kong and the loan growth outlook there is helpful. Just looking at Slide 17, where you present underlying loan figures on a constant-currency basis excluding the red-inked balances. And the numbers there look fairly stable over the last 5 quarters. And I was just wondering if you could give us any view on how this could progress from here, with obviously particular trade balances probably -- or potentially stabilizing at the lower level. And in particular, I would be interested in your comments, one, on the potential for loan growth within the U.K.; and in the U.K. specifically, mortgages. Just looking at your disclosure, it appears that deposits kept growing whilst the loan balances, at least on the retail side, kept fairly stable. Do you see the scope there to utilize your competitive funding advantage you have in the U.K. to engage in stronger mortgage grow in the U.K. here going forward? And the second question, on trade finance and element related to commodity prices. With some of the major commodities having quite a rebound in the first quarter, could we see here trade balances expand going forward?\\nStuart Gulliver\\nSo on U.K. mortgages, actually, U.K. mortgage new business is up about 57% year-on-year. There's actually about a $2 billion, nearly $3 billion increase in mortgages. So yes, we are trying to do that. And we've signed up more third-party agents in the first quarter as well. And we've also seen a considerable increase in the number of mortgages coming through on our direct channel, which is actually starting to pick up quite significantly. So yes, we are focused on doing that. So as I say, intermediary performance is up. New business is up. And the amount being onboarded online is also up, so we are trying to do that. If you come to your piece about -- or your question about trade balances and commodity prices, yes, that should really result in some kind of rebound. A big chunk of the documentary credit fall is related to softer commodity prices and actually just lower shipments taking place of commodities. And I think also that the ability to grow the book in U.K., Europe and North America and in Mexico, you can see, in the first quarter, that actually is where we've seen loan growth. Remember also running through these numbers, as we set out on Slide 17, is going in the other direction, obviously, the reduction in the U.S. legacy portfolios, so there is a net reduction going through as we dispose of this as well and as we dispose of legacy assets. So I mean I think we're reasonably confident that we can continue to grow loans and advances and that there is -- as you say, there's a stable picture over the last 5 quarters, there's not a declining picture, within which we may basically offset the declines due to disposals of legacy positions.\\nOperator\\nOur next question today comes from Michael Helsby from Bank of America.\\nMichael Helsby\\nI've got 3 questions: 2 bigger picture; 1 is just a point of detail, please. Firstly, on -- just on ROE, Slide 9. Your costs ex Brazil, you're pretty much already at your 2017 run rate. And despite that, when I look at Slide 12, it shows that your group ROE, excluding significant items and levy, is just 7.6%. So I appreciate that the revenue environment was challenged in the first quarter, but there's a trend where it's been challenged for a while. So I guess the question for me is what's plan B? It really doesn't look like you're going to get anywhere close to your greater-than-10% ROE target, so can you come back to that $7.3 billion cost run rate and make it significantly lower? That's question one. Question two is on Slide 15. You're talking about dividend growth, and you're linking it to longer-term profitability. I asked this last quarter, and your shares are yielding more now since then. Is 8% -- clearly, the market's very worried that you're going to cut the dividend, not grow the dividend, so my question really is what's the longer-term earnings power that you would need to believe in for you to recommend that the board does actually do what the market's worrying about and cut the dividend? And then the third question is just on tax rate. The tax rate was 25.7% this quarter. You mentioned that was because of the U.K. surcharge. Should we use that now as the ongoing tax rate on a clean basis? I just ask as consensus has only got 23%.\\nIain Mackay\\nYes. On the last question, yes, I would use that 25% to 26% as a effective tax rate going forward, informed largely by the U.K. corporate surcharge on taxes. I think, on the ROE, Michael, there's a couple things to bear in mind. That ROE includes really the effect of Brazil coming through. And as we dispose of Brazil, that knocks -- that adds about 20 basis points to return on risk-weighted assets, largely coming through the retail bank and the Commercial Banking businesses. And so that is helpful both in terms of the returns equation as well as the capital and the expense equation. On the costs, you make the assumption that we're pretty much done on costs, and that simply is not the case. We -- the $7.5 billion versus the $7.3 billion belies the fact that we've got continued investment to do in growth initiatives that focus on the longer-term revenue-generating and profit-generating capability of the group. It also focuses on the longer-term requirements for investment around Global Standards and regulatory programs and the offset of inflation. So there remains a very significant piece of work to do from a cost perspective. And delivering against that and at an exit run rate in 2017 equivalent to 2014, whilst continuing to build the balance sheet, albeit perhaps at somewhat slower rates, should increment revenues as we work through those. And I think when you take those factors together and hopefully, but not necessarily planning for a little bit of assistance from U.S. rates, then the mathematics would suggest to us that we can move back towards that 10% rate and, hopefully, grow beyond that. But I think, within the context of 2017, getting there is obviously a pretty difficult challenge, but that's what we're focused on delivering against and a particularly strong focus on those things that are directly within our control; and then taking advantage of any revenue growth opportunities, for example, those that Stuart laid out earlier on. The guidance on dividends hasn't changed, Michael. And it's not going to change unless there's a culmination of factors relating to a wider recessionary environment in the markets in which we operate or a significantly higher set of capital requirements. And as you know, notwithstanding various policy setters' proclamations to the effect that there is no Basel IV, there would certainly seem to be a Basel IV out there with a wide range of reassessment that's in the process of being consulted upon. So I think, until we get capital requirements nailed down, which a year ago I was optimistic we'd be much closer, but I think the events over the last few months have perhaps moved that out into future, sadly, but the guidance on dividends hasn't changed. And if the underlying economic factors and performance factors do change significantly, then we will certainly update you on that, but no change at this point.\\nMichael Helsby\\nSo just on the -- sorry, my first question, Iain. I appreciate there's a lot going on in the cost line, but I guess what I'm trying to get to is if the revenue picture doesn't improve, then clearly, you're only left with one lever to get to your ROE, and that's costs. So I guess the question is to what extent can you lower that $7.3 billion run rate? Is it just off the table because it's too difficult and you're working so hard to deliver that number in isolation?\\nIain Mackay\\nNo, it's not, Michael, but we'll make that determination when the time is right to make that determination. And 2 bad months at the beginning of 2016 aren't really the basis on which we'd make a decision that affects the long-term future of the group.\\nStuart Gulliver\\nI think, Michael, we've had 2 difficult months, January and February; and 2 okay months, March and April. So there's not a trend yet.\\nOperator\\nOur next question today comes from Chris Manners from Morgan Stanley.\\nChris Manners\\nSo 3 questions, if I may. The first one was on Slide 17. Looks actually to be pretty encouraging, the market share gains you're making. Could I ask you maybe to share with us which competitors are you taking share from? You don't have to name them but maybe by type, just give us a sense. And also, now that the volatility has stabilized a little bit after the first 2 months of the year, are the competition regrouping to any degree that you can see? Second question was -- sorry.\\nStuart Gulliver\\nSo we -- yes, carry on.\\nChris Manners\\nSo yes, the second question was just going to be on the Other revenue. That's something I always find it a little bit tricky to forecast. I was just looking at Page -- at Slide 7. It's obviously plus $179 million this quarter. At this time last year, it was minus $200 million. But the last few quarters have been roughly a negative number of $200 million-ish, yet when we think about that line going forward, should that be a sort of plus number, minus number, flat? How should we think about the Other revenue trending? And the last question was just on impairment. I thought it was interesting context you gave us on Slide 18 there of where the impairment charges have been over time. I see you've picked the time period back to 1997, and you've shown us some average impairments in percentages there that seem to be a little bit ahead of where you're running at the moment. Are we -- should we take from that, that you're expecting normalized impairment charges to start creeping up a little bit? Or how should we interpret those?\\nIain Mackay\\nI think, taking the third, first, I wouldn't necessarily interpret anything for it. We provide it as information that, hopefully, is useful to you, to give you some indication that in -- certainly, in absolute terms, on relative terms, the loan impairment charges in the business that matter most to us have seldom risen above a significantly high level.\\nStuart Gulliver\\nAnd the other reason for giving it, Chris, is obviously, fourth quarter -- if you look first quarter of '16, it's much lower than the fourth quarter of '15, but actually much higher than the first quarter. So it's a volatile series. So we wanted to show you what the average was because we thought we'd get a question as to what the average was.\\nIain Mackay\\nYes. In terms of Other revenues, I'll -- Stuart will cover the first one, on competitors.\\nStuart Gulliver\\nYes.\\nIain Mackay\\nBut in terms of Other revenues, I'm not going to try and give you any guidance on the Other. The Other segment, the Other line picks up inter-segment eliminations and consolidation within the group. And it also picks up group elements. And what we had coming through in that particular line in the first quarter was a bit of a hedge ineffectiveness coming through some of the parent company debt that was issued some time ago; and interest rate, whereas interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives that hedge the issuance of that debt. And when you saw some significant movements in both interest rate and foreign exchange in first quarter, then that's really what flowed through in terms of the Other income. So we had a positive effect of about $179 million in the first quarter, and that was largely from hedging effects in this -- on those interest rates and foreign exchange derivatives against holding company debt issued in recent years; and then a negative effect in the first quarter of the preceding year, which was largely in the elimination of inter-segment items. So it is -- it's got some volatility in that line, as you've seen, coming through in recent quarters but, I think a significant amount -- the ability to predict that is largely influenced by the very factors that we saw coming through this quarter in terms of movements in interest rate, foreign exchange and their impact on holding company debt.\\nStuart Gulliver\\nSo looking at competitors\\u2026\\nChris Manners\\nSo we'll be\\u2026\\nStuart Gulliver\\nSorry, carry on.\\nChris Manners\\nYes, I was just going to say so would we be sensible to call that a 0 as we model it going forward just because it's volatile? It doesn't have like an underlying run rate that it should have basically, is that fair to say?\\nIain Mackay\\nNo, there's not an underlying run rate. And it is not an easy item to predict until you start seeing effects coming through: interest rate, foreign exchange and other market movements.\\nStuart Gulliver\\nSo on competitors, it's a bit difficult to sort of indicate who they are without even by giving geographic descriptions without being kind of inappropriate on a call like this. If you think about those banks which have changed strategy and pulled out of Asia, those are the people that we have taken market share from. So the easiest way to do it is by a negative. So the U.S. banks remain highly competitive, but some of the other banks, some other parts of the world have given up on their Asian initiatives.\\nChris Manners\\nOkay. Maybe some U.K. banks?\\nStuart Gulliver\\nPossibly.\\nIain Mackay\\nIt was quite some time ago.\\nStuart Gulliver\\nPossibly. Honestly, Chris, you can kind of work it out, but I think on a call like this, it's not appropriate.\\nChris Manners\\nNo, fair enough.\\nStuart Gulliver\\nOkay, thank you.\\nOperator\\nWe will take our last question today from Stephen Andrews from Deutsche Bank.\\nStephen Andrews\\nJust coming back to the dividend again, just to work out what the actual cash payout ratio is at the moment. I think on Slide 10, you said the dividends, net of scrip, were about $2.1 billion in Q1. And I think you're including some of the pref in that. So am I right in thinking that the underlying payout was about $1.9 billion on the ordinary dividend, so the scrip take-up in the first quarter on the larger, final dividend for last year was probably in the sort of 55%, 60% range? And then the second question is just on the -- your ability to pay the dividend is usually a function of just the cash coming up from different parts of the group. How should we think about -- or how do you think about this slowdown in volumes in Asia? Sitting on the ground in Hong Kong, it feels in some way structural in that you're largely a U.S. dollar lender, a Hong Kong dollar lender, and with the RMB weakening, the demand you had coming from China for U.S. dollar borrowing just isn't there anymore. Whilst that is having an impact on revenues, is this -- should we expect the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp. to be consuming significantly less capital than it was, so be upstreaming more capital going forward than it had done previously?\\nIain Mackay\\nThe scrip take-up on the fourth interim dividend. So we account for dividends on an accounting basis within our capital, so the fourth quarter dividend was accounted for in the capital ratios in the fourth quarter of last year. And the scrip take-up on that was about, just under 10% of the total, which represented about, I think, $440 million, $450 million in terms of cash conservation at the group level. In terms of the upstreaming of dividends...\\nStephen Andrews\\nSorry. I was on -- I meant on Slide 10, the $2.1 billion dividends, net of scrip, which I assume was for the full year dividend.\\nIain Mackay\\nNo, that's an assumption around net of scrip as it relates to the first dividend declared.\\nStuart Gulliver\\nSo that's the first $0.10 of this year.\\nIain Mackay\\nYes, yes. So that relates only to the interim for the first quarter, if you like, or the first interim dividend, to be more precise. In terms of dividend upstreaming from the subsidiaries, we hold the subsidiaries accountable to upstream somewhere between 50% to 70% of their profit attributable after tax. And that is applicable to all the subsidiaries which are in a profit-generating situation. Certainly, as far as Hong Kong goes, like other major subsidiaries in the group, they obviously have to meet local regulatory requirements which the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation does comfortably. And again, the dividend distribution from the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp. is going to follow exactly the same principles as the dividend from ourselves to the ultimate shareholder of the group. It's going to be informed by regulatory capital requirements, the profit-generating capability of the business. And what you can clearly see is a business that continues to be very strongly capital generative.\\nStuart Gulliver\\nThank you very much. Okay, that brings the call to an end. Thank you.\\nIain Mackay\\nThank you.\\nOperator\\nThank you, ladies and gentlemen. That concludes the call for the HSBC Holdings plc's earnings release for first quarter 2016. You may now disconnect.\",\n          \"HSBC Holdings plc, Q1 2024 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2024\\n30/4/24\\nOperator\\nWelcome, ladies and gentlemen, to the analyst and investor webinar on the 2024 first quarter results for HSBC Holdings plc. For your information, this webinar is being recorded. We are now ready to start the webinar, so I will hand over to Mark Tucker, Group Chairman.\\nMark Tucker\\nGood morning to those of you in London, and good afternoon to those of you in Hong Kong. I'm joining you today from London and have alongside me know enjoy. I'll be making some short opening remarks before handing over to Noel.\\nAs you may have already seen, we have announced today that Noel has informed the Board of his intention to retire from the bank after nearly 5 years in the role. The Board and I would like to pay tribute to Noel's exceptional contribution during his time.\\nAs Group Chief Executive, he drags both our transformation strategy as well as creating a simpler, more focused business through the disposal of assets in the U.S., France and Canada. This has enabled us to deliver an improved performance, achieving record profits last year and create a platform for future growth and development.\\nNow, you'll hear from him in a second, has decided it's the right time to step back and find a better balance between his personal and business commitments. As you would expect, the Board keeps succession planning under constant review. We already have started a robust and rigorous process to find our next group Chief Executive.\\nThis process will look at both internal and external candidates. I'm very pleased that now has agreed to remain in his role while this process takes place, ensuring a smooth and orderly transition. And on a personal note, I'd like to thank Noel for his unwavering commitment and dedication to HSBC, which he joined 37 years ago.\\nNow, it's been a pleasure and privilege to work with and alongside you.\\nNoel Quinn\\nThank you, Mark. I'm very grateful for your support, guidance, friendship and partnership. I'm proud of what my HSBC colleagues and I have achieved together over the past 5 years. Over that period, we have hit some significant milestones, record profits last year, the strongest returns in a decade and the highest dividend since 2008.\\nAs Mark mentioned, we have created a more focused business, and I believe we have built a strong platform for the bank's next phase of development and growth. That's why I feel this is the right time to step back to find a better balance between my personal and business commitments with the intention going forward after a break of pursuing a portfolio career.\\nWhen I reflect back on the last 37 years, I have held intensive leadership roles, particularly since I took over the U.K. Commercial Bank in October of 2008. After 16 years of intensive leadership, I'm ready for a change. But it's also a natural inflection point for the bank as it comes to the end of the current transformation phase. It's an ideal time to bring in new leadership.\\nThe Board has now started a process to find my successor, and I'm very happy to continue in my role as that process takes place. Rest assured, I will be working hard to ensure a smooth and orderly transition for my successor and to keep the momentum going in this business, as you have seen in Q1. Until then, it's business as usual.\\nSo, let's now turn to our Q1 results, which have showed continued progress. We had a good first quarter. Reported profit before tax was $12.7 billion. Excluding notable items, profit before tax was $9 billion. Our return on tangible equity was 16.4%, excluding notable items. I'm also pleased with the further capital distributions of $8.8 billion, which brings the total amount of distributed capital by way of dividends and buybacks over the last 15 months to almost $28 billion.\\nAnd we are on track to meet all of our previously communicated guidance for 2024. I will now hand over to Georges to take you through the numbers.\\nGeorges Elhedery\\nThank you, Noel. I'd like to open by paying tribute to the enormous contribution Noel has made to the bank. I've greatly enjoyed working alongside him. And I know everyone at the bank has appreciated this strong and effective leadership. I'm also grateful for the support he has shown me personally since my appointment as CFO, 15 months ago.\\nThe Board has announced the process to find a successor, and I know Non and I will continue to remain very focused on the job at hand until that process has been completed. Turning now to the numbers. Reported profit before tax of $12.7 billion was down $0.3 billion in the first quarter of 2023 on a constant currency basis.\\nExcluding notable items, profit before tax was $9 billion, down $0.4 billion on last year's first quarter. On an annualized basis, we delivered a return on tangible equity of 26.1% or 16.4%, excluding notable items. We completed the $2 billion share buyback announced in February in 2 months. This means that since the end of 2022, we have bought back 6% of our outstanding shares. And the trend of strong shareholder distributions continues this quarter.\\nWe have announced, as Noel said, a further $8.8 billion of distributions consisting of first interim dividend for '24 of $0.10 per share. The special dividend of $0.21 per share from the Canada sale proceeds and a new share buyback of up to $3 billion, which we plan to begin right after the AGM and complete within 3 months.\\nFinally, we are reconfirming all of our 2024 guidance, including a mid-teens return on tangible equity, excluding notable items and our commitment to limit cost growth to around 5% on a target basis.\\nSo, on the next slide, reported profit before tax of $12.7 billion included $4.8 billion gain on the sale of Canada, partly offset by the $1.1 billion impairment on the classification of Argentina as held for sale. Excluding notable items, profit before tax was $9 billion with revenue growth offset primarily by higher costs and ECLs. Revenue of $20.8 billion was up $0.5 billion on the first quarter of last year.\\nExcluding notable items, revenue was $17 billion, which was up $0.5 billion on the first quarter of last year, with growth in banking NII, partly offset by lower fee and other income. Within that, we saw high single-digit growth in multi-jurisdictional revenue in the first quarter, which underlines the value of our global network.\\nBanking NII of $11.3 billion was up $0.6 billion on the fourth quarter on the reported FX basis, mainly driven by Argentina banking NII as well as the nonrecurrence of the cash flow hedge reclassification in the last quarter. Looking ahead to the rest of the year, a few things to keep in mind.\\nFirst, our Q1 banking NII included $0.3 billion from Canada, which will not repeat in future quarters due to the completion of the sale in March this year. Second, first quarter banking NII also included $0.5 billion from Argentina. This contribution will continue to be highly volatile until the sale is completed, which we expect to be within the next 12 months. Please, therefore, do not extrapolate the $0.5 billion run rate for the remainder of the year.\\nOur banking NII guidance assumes a contribution of around $1 billion in full year '24 for Argentina, which is in line with full year 2023. Third, the banking NII outlook has improved in several respects since we announced our full year results in February. The Hong Kong time deposit mix remained stable as a percentage of customer deposits in the quarter and markets are now pricing in more modest cuts to interest rates.\\nHowever, it is still early in the year, and these things can change. So, we are maintaining our 2024 banking NII guidance of at least $41 billion. Turning to fee and other income. Wholesale transaction banking was down by 9%, primarily due to the normalization of FX revenues compared to a very strong foreign exchange performance in the first quarter of last year, which benefited from higher market volatility.\\nFees from Global Payment Solutions had another good quarter, up by 6%. Wealth is another growth area that had a very good quarter, up by 14% on the same period last year as our investment continued to drive improved results. Private Banking was a standout performer, mainly driven by increased customer activity in brokerage and trading in Asia, but growth in wealth has been broad-based.\\nTo illustrate this, we acquired around 135,000 new-to-bank retail wealth customers in Hong Kong in the quarter. Approximately 60% of these were nonresidents attracted by our service and product capabilities in Hong Kong.\\nBuilding on previous quarters, we attracted $27 billion of net new invested assets, of which $19 billion were in Asia. And our insurance new business CSM was $0.8 billion, up from $0.4 billion in the first quarter of last year.\\nOn credit, expected credit losses were $0.7 billion in the quarter, equivalent to 30 basis points of average loans. These were primarily Stage 3 charges across retail and wholesale. There was a $54 million charge related to our Mainland China commercial real estate portfolio.\\nWhile challenges remain within the sector, we expect a more benign ECL contribution from it than last year. We remain comfortable with our current level of provisions and continue monitoring developments closely. And we are reconfirming our 2024 ECL guidance of around 40 basis points of average loans, recognizing the overall uncertainty from the flow-through effect of higher rates on the economy.\\nNext, we are on track to meet our target of limiting 2024 cost growth to around 5% on a target basis. This quarter's year-on-year cost growth was impacted by 3 items. First, we chose to face the accrual of our performance-related pay more evenly this year than we did last year. This accounted for 2 percentage points of cost growth this quarter. We do not currently expect the total amount of performance-related pay for 2024 to be significantly different to 2023. So, the accrual will be lower over the next 3 quarters than it was in the same period last year.\\nSecond, HSBC Innovation Banking contributed to 1 percentage point of cost growth this quarter as we only acquired SBB U.K. in the middle of March last year. We intend to provide you with a fuller update on that business at the half year, but I'm pleased that it has good momentum. In the U.K., we onboarded 183 new-to-bank innovation banking client groups in the quarter, the best quarter since acquisition.\\nFinally, another percentage point of the cost growth in the quarter was due to the Bank Finland levy and the incremental FDIC special assessment. We remain committed to cost discipline, and we are reconfirming our guidance of limiting 2024 cost growth to circa 5% on a target basis, inclusive of all the above items.\\nOn lending and deposits. There was good loan growth in the U.K., the Middle East, Mexico and Asia, excluding Hong Kong. Loan demand in Hong Kong remains subdued, largely due to the high interest rate differential with Mainland China.\\nOverall, we continue to expect mid-single-digit loan growth over the medium to long term, but we expect demand to remain subdued in the near term. Deposits were down 2%. This was due to a range of factors, including seasonality, the switch from time deposits to wealth products in Hong Kong and our deliberate choice to forsake some highly price-sensitive deposits.\\nNext, our CET 1 ratio was 15.2%, up 40 basis points on the fourth quarter. Organic capital generation and the gain from the sale of the Canadian business enabled us to announce $8.8 billion of capital distributions this quarter. This includes a share buyback of up to $3 billion, which is expected to have an impact of around 40 basis points on our CET1 ratio in the second quarter.\\nFor modeling purposes, please note that the $5.8 billion of dividends announced today as well as the $5.9 billion in respect of the ordinary dividend announced at the full year results in February will both be reflected in TNAV in the second quarter. At closing of the sale of HSBC Argentina, which is expected within 12 months, we will also recognize $4.9 billion of foreign exchange reserve recycling losses subject to any movement in this reserve up until completion.\\nThese losses have already been accumulated in capital over the previous years. Therefore, recognition in the P&L will have no impact on CET1 nor on TNAV. Finally, looking forward to the rest of the year, our good first quarter puts us on track and we are reconfirming all of our 2024 guidance.\\nA mid-teens return on tangible equity, excluding notable items, a banking NII of at least $41 billion, ECLs of around 40 basis points cost growth limited to around 5% on a target basis and a 50% dividend payout ratio.\\nAnd with that, Louis, can we please go to Q&A.\\nOperator\\n[Operator instructions] Our first question today comes from Joseph Dickerson at Jefferies.\\nJoseph Dickerson\\nCongrats, Noel on a great tenure at the bank and well done for the ROE and the capital return. I guess, just in terms of my question, the PD migration in Hong Kong, if you go back to the way you were computing it previously actually looks like it improved quarter-on-quarter and certainly under the new definition, has stabilized.\\nI think it's Slide 17, if I'm not mistaken, in the presentation. Is that a little bit better than where your expectations were a few months ago? I know when I was in Hong Kong recently, it sounded like things were starting to stabilize, but is that better than where you were thinking a few months ago?\\nAnd then secondly, on the buybacks, is the $3 billion number due more to the calendar effect? Or are you looking to kind of boost the run rate there from the $2 billion in the quarter?\\nGeorges Elhedery\\nThank you, Joseph. So, first, on the time deposit reclassification, we have actually reclassified some private bank term deposits to time deposits. This is due to the observation of their behavior and the recognition that they better classify this time deposits. This rebases the number. But as you could see from the 2 choices we have, it does not affect the trend.\\nSo, therefore, the trend that we've seen under both classifications is the same, and we've seen the first quarter stable quarter-on-quarter. It's too early to call it a peak, but we've always expected migration this year to be slower than what we've seen last year. And this just confirms the trend change from what we've seen in full year 2023.\\nAs regards to your buyback question, so the short answer is, yes, this is indeed due to calendar effects. We just completed a EUR 2 billion buyback in 2 months. That's about $1 billion a month. That is the fastest run rate we've done in terms of share buybacks ever.\\nWe are now announcing a EUR 3 billion buyback, which we intend to do over the next 3 months, starting after AGM. We will see how the run rate goes, it will remain at the $1 billion run rate. We will see how it will go.\\nAs regards any future amount of buyback or whether we're doing a buyback, one, it remains our intention to return excess capital to our shareholders through a rolling series of share buyback.\\nAnd, second, we will decide on a quarter-by-quarter basis based on our capital outlook, the loan growth outlook and other parameters as and when every quarter.\\nOperator\\n[Operator instructions] Our next question today comes from Raul Sinha at JPMorgan.\\nRaul Sinha\\nMaybe 2 from me as well. Just doing, George, on this point on distribution and looking at the sort of moving parts for capital, one of the interesting things in this quarter was the move up in RWAs. I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more color on the growth in RWAs. The EUR 7 billion of increase driven by asset quality trends. I think you're calling out is predominantly in Asia.\\nWhat should we think about the sort of outlook for RWA growth from here even if loan build is muted, just to get a sense of the amount of capital that you will have in content terms for distributions?\\nAnd I guess the second question to Noel, just maybe a question for your broader thoughts, no. The 5 years proceeding have been pretty extraordinary, not just for HSBC, but I guess, for a lot of people given in your markets given the pandemic. But when we look at where HSBC is now, you exited Canada, you announced Argentina. You're in the process of exiting quite a few smaller markets.\\nReturn on tangible equity is already in the mid-teens. You're buying back stock at $3 billion a quarter, you've got a special dividend as well. I guess what I'm really interested in is from here onwards, what do you think is left to do for the group to kind of progress?\\nGeorges Elhedery\\nThank you, Raul. I'll start with your first question first. So, on RWA outlook. So the RWA growth, we called on a quarter-on-quarter basis, $24 billion. First, about 40% of it related to lending and other asset growth. And as you can see from our lending book, we've grown our lending book by EUR 5 billion. There's a number of areas of growth that contributed to around 40% of it, $9 billion.\\nThen we've had a $5 billion market tristRWA growth. This is due to a pickup in NSS activity against a subdued 4Q, and it's more in line with their activity levels in the first 3 quarters of the year, if you want. And this is the normalization of the market's activity.\\nAnd then there is $7 billion, which we classified broadly as asset quality. Now, asset quality, first, it is a continuous exercise. We do this portfolio monitoring review on a regular basis. We have recognized across a number of geographies and a number of sectors, certain names, which we've decided to downgrade on the basis that the interest rate pressure on their cash flows has been more severe.\\nYou will not see an equivalent of that downgrade in ECL. And that's mainly because for many of these customers, their balance sheet remains strong. So, we're comfortable with their balance sheet and therefore, there is no ECL implication from this downgrade. But just closing the loop, this RWA downgrade, you will see some of it materialize in our Stage 3 loans, where we increased our Stage 3 loans by about $2 billion, and that's exactly the mapping of some of this asset quality.\\nWith regards to how we look forward, we are very comfortable where we are today. Our credit metrics remain solid. As I say, the balance sheet of our customers remains strong for a number of them for at least the exposure that is collateralized. We're very comfortable with the level of collateralization and the LTV. And therefore, we do not foresee at this stage today any additional action we should be taking.\\nWe will obviously monitor the book on a regular basis as we always do. Noel?\\nNoel Quinn\\nThank you. It has certainly been an extraordinary 5 years, I should say, not just for HSBC, but for the world. And I'm really pleased and grateful I want to pay tribute to the team for the way they've collectively navigated that. And during that whole process, the external environment executed on a complex but absolutely critical transformation plan over the past 5 years.\\nAnd the outcome of that hard work is evident in the financial performance last year and the financial performance in Q1. I also want to say thanks to Mark, with such volatility in an external environment. Any CEO needs the support of their chair, their advice, their guidance, and I've had that all the way through and have had the support from the Board all the way through in navigating what has been a very complex external environment.\\nBut the team, the Board, Mark, collectively, we've done a good job of navigating it. Now, if I look forward, I'm not going to give to do list to my successor because that is not the fair thing to do to anyone. But I will give you some thoughts about what we as a team are very much focused on. And I'm focused on for as long as I'm still CEO, and that is continuing the momentum.\\nYou don't work as hard as we worked for the past 5 years and then take the eye off the ball at this moment in time. So, I'm very focused on a smooth, orderly transition. I'm very focused on continued execution of the strategy. I want to clarify our thinking on one element of the strategy. We have exited a lot of businesses, a lot of RWAs over the past 5 years.\\nThe one thing we've protected whilst doing that is the international core of HSBC. The countries we remain in, the businesses we remain in are fundamentally now focused on the international nature and essence of HSBC, and we will continue to do that.\\nOur key requirement is to continue to deliver good returns that are sustainable and repeatable whilst also taking advantage of the growth opportunities as they emerge in a world that becomes more stable and there are inherent in our customer franchise.\\nTherefore, we're very focused on continuing the development of wealth, our transaction banking capabilities, our global wholesale banking capabilities and then being ready for when corporate loan demand picks up, we can take advantage of that to couple good returns with sustainable growth.\\nAnd I think you've seen evidence of that in these results. Hong Kong is subdued at the moment, but we understand why with the rate differential in China. But if you look at the rest of the world, as George said, there's balance sheet growth in Wholesale Banking, in the rest of Asia, in the Middle East, in U.K., in Europe. We're seeing good growth elsewhere.\\nSo, it's about focus, momentum, continuing to couple good returns with good growth.\\nOperator\\n[Operator instructions] Our next question today comes from Jeremy Hugh at CICC.\\nJeremy Hugh\\nSo, the first question is on deposits. We're glad to see that cat migration in Hong Kong is slowing down, but if not stabilized at this level. But on the other hand, I think the bank has seen some deposit outflow in Q1, while your Hong Kong local peers still see some deposit growth. So, I'm wondering if there is a strategic trade-off between the deposit growth and the cost for you at this stage? And how do you see that trend in the rest of the year?\\nThe second question is on the structural hedge. So, I'm wondering if this quarter, you could share with us some breakdown of our structural hedge and how much did we benefit from the reinvestment of the structural hedge? And if there is any run rate that we can refer to?\\nGeorges Elhedery\\nThank you, Jeremy. So, on your first question about deposits in Hong Kong. So, if you remember at Q4, our deposits in Hong Kong have increased by about $14 billion. What we've seen in Q1 this year is a decrease of about $16 billion. Therefore, you can see seasonality playing across the 2 quarters, and therefore, is broadly stable across the 2 quarters.\\nWhat happened though is, some of these deposit inflows in Q4 related to some deposit campaigns we were driving to drive some of our deposits into wealth. And when you look at Q1, while you see the deposit outflows, you also can see that $19 billion of our net new invested assets were in Asia.\\nTherefore, a chunk of these outflows has manifested or translated into wealth inflows for us, which was the purpose of the campaign in Q4 and explains if you want the seasonality of this deposit.\\nSecond, look, we have a powerful deposit franchise. We have a very cherished and viable franchise. We continue globally being a very attractive deposit proposition for both our retail and wholesale customers. We cherish this. We continue investing in our deposit capabilities. And throughout the last 6 quarters, you've seen how our deposit base has been very stable with our deposit costs being relatively benign compared to some of our peers. Therefore, I won't comment on month-to-month movements between ourselves and our peers.\\nIf I move on to your second question about the structural hedge. So, first, you would have noticed that we increased this quarter, the structural hedge by about $10 billion, taking it to $487 million, with the average weighted average life broadly unchanged at just shy of 3 years.\\nSecond, we commit at this stage to continue our structural hedging activity. Obviously, this will remain subject to market conditions, but we will continue the trend that we put in Q1 based on current market outlook. This activity of additional structural hedging will contribute to a mild headwind toward banking NII. And this is due to the fact that the rate curves are inverted as you know, and you can do the math.\\nBut equally, we also are reinvesting maturing structural hedges at higher rates. And this reinvestment of maturing of structural hedges at higher rates is a tailwind into banking NII. Between the 2 of those effects, the structural hedge activity for the full year 2024 would remain a net tailwind to our banking NII. We have not yet quantified to the market that tailwind.\\nWe're looking at enhancing our disclosure in this space. But that tailwind has been factored into our guidance of at least $41 billion bank NII and obviously, factored into our return on tangible equity mid-teens guidance.\\nOperator\\nThe next question today comes from Jason Napier at UBS.\\nJason Napier\\nFirst of all, just to echo the best wishes, Noel, for the next chapter of your career and private life, I think, a well-earned rebalancing.\\nGeorge, I just wondered whether you talk a little bit within the context of higher for longer, you've referenced subdued loan demand in Hong Kong due to the differentials in interest rates. And I just wonder whether one of your peers has spoken at some length about looking forward to a change in asset mix as loan demand comes back as a way to defend margins and revenue.\\nSo, I wonder whether you might talk a little bit about whether that's a material part of the plan? And sort of what do you think that means for revenue sort of evolution in the next few quarters? I think I certainly was somewhat surprised that we didn't see an upgrade to banking NII guidance this quarter. I know you don't rebalance every quarter, but I just wonder whether you might talk to the role that Higher for longer has on asset mix and then on credit demand.\\nAnd then secondly, wealth was phenomenal in Q1. I know there's a part of the business that's quite closely linked to what goes on with the Hang Seng Index, which is now 20% in in a short space of time. But I just wonder whether you could talk to the sustainability of those run rates. Is that the strategy delivering the sort of net new money flows? Or is there an element of sort of market volume there that we should be a little bit careful about?\\nGeorges Elhedery\\nThank you, Jason. So, first on Banking NII, we recognize there are kind of a couple of encouraging developments. The first one is the higher for longer on the rate side that would look like more favorable than when we discussed last in February. And, the second one we just touched on, which is the balance sheet mix, specifically in Hong Kong, where we've seen term deposits remain stable for this quarter.\\nSo, we recognize these tailwinds to our banking NII, but we also recognize quite early in the year, and these factors can still change. So this is why we didn't change our guidance. And as you said, Jason, I don't think you should expect us to update our guidance every quarter. We would reconsider this every quarter. But for this quarter, we're just sticking with our at least $41 billion.\\nIn terms of the wealth performance, so recognize mid-teens percentage growth in wealth, 34% for our private bank. I would say a couple of things. The first one is, yes, this is an area that we've already said it's a focused strategic area. We are investing in this area. Big part of our investments goes towards this area, and we're very pleased to see the results of our investments generate revenue fairly quickly.\\nYou can see that through net new invested assets growth. You can see that through our CSM, new business CSM growth in insurance as well as in the actual revenue performance. This being said, I would just caution you not to annualize the numbers you're seeing because Q1 2023 had somewhat subdued January in it when China and Hong Kong were still closed.\\nSo, therefore, you've seen more pickup in activity in the Q1 '23 at the back end of it, whereas we had a full proper Q1 '24. So, there is an element of not annualizing the performance, but expecting that performance to continue growing.\\nI just realized I didn't touch on your asset mix question of the first question. Look, we do not foresee a material change in our asset mix. We had seen for the last few quarters of last year, the main growth take place in mortgages and recognizing mortgages have seen very competitive levels both in the U.K. and Hong Kong, and the margins have been quite tight.\\nAs we start seeing pickup in wholesale demand, as we start peeing pickup in unsecured lending, we are more hopeful that those will drive higher margins than if you want what we see in mortgages. And our numbers in Q1 did show that this pickup definitely is there in areas of Asia, Southeast Asia, India, the Middle East, the U.K., et cetera. And the next in line for that pickup will be Hong Kong, which we expect at some stage later in the year as we see dollar rates ease.\\nOperator\\n[Operator instructions] Our next question comes from Perlie Mong from KBW.\\nPerlie Mong\\nCan I just dig a little bit further into Jason's question just now on higher for longer. So, I know you probably don't like to comment on longer-term NII. But I guess in a higher for longer rate environment, which is how are you thinking about the trajectory going from here because it sounds to me that deposit migration is probably, well, stabilized a lot.\\nAnd I would have thought any longer pricing that hasn't already come through will come through in the next few months. And I guess in a higher for longer rate environment, you can probably build more hedges at better rates as well, et cetera. And there's obviously a tailwind as you mentioned in this year already. So, how does that inform your thinking on your medium-term RoTE? So I guess that's the first question.\\nAnd the second question, again, on broader activity level, maybe not just on credit. So, again, I guess just noting your point that Hong Kong might be a mix in line to pick up. But I guess, overall, the emerging market is probably not benefiting in terms of activity level and in terms of capital inflows from the higher U.S. rates.\\nSo, how does that impact, I guess, trading activities and capital flows, et cetera, just how are you thinking about the flip side of hirer longer?\\nGeorges Elhedery\\nThank you, Perlie. So first, look, yes, we recognize higher for longer is definitely a tailwind or a reduction of a headwind we've forecast in our banking NII. And as I said, there has been a number of manifestation of tailwinds now compared to when we last spoke in February.\\nBut equally, it is early in the year. And as you've seen, these things do change. And we now, therefore, want to bake in some sense of uncertainty due to the changing parameters. We will update some longer than what we're updating but not at this quarter, barely. So, do expect us coming in the future quarters and give you further outlook for the future.\\nI would say the one parameter, just to keep in mind, as you start planning for '25 is take Argentina out because, obviously, subject to the sale completing, which we expect to complete in the next 12 months, that potential $1 billion contribution from Argentina will go away from our banking NII. That's the most kind of predictable parameter where we stand today as you look into 2025.\\nIn terms of the broader activity level, first, if you look at the wealth performance, it just demonstrates how wealth remains very resilient. And that's particularly true in Hong Kong, but very much so across Asia. Second, when you look at our transaction banking activities, apart from foreign exchange, which has an idiosyncrasy related to Q1 '23 with a very high volatility has performed across the various areas of its fee earning activities.\\nAnd then our activity is very much benefiting from cross-border trends. If you look at some of the investments or foreign direct investments or trade flows taking place intra region in Asia between China and ASEAN between India and ASEAN, between India and the west, et cetera, all of those trends are growing. I mean the numbers are staggering in some cases. And these are the activities that our business is operating on.\\nSo, therefore, while recognizing that there will be some interest rate challenges for borrowers at these levels, there is still a very strong underlying network activity, which is benefiting our overall businesses, particularly in wholesale transaction banking, anyway.\\nPerlie Mong\\nOn that, it's just I've also noticed that China exports volumes have been going up, but value has been coming down. And that is in part because of various things. FX is be part of it but also government subsidies. How does that affect your, I guess, your profitability in the region, volumes going up, the value is going down?\\nGeorges Elhedery\\nPerlie, if I can just give you an indication. What we are seeing at the moment is a very strong level of activity of China corporates expanding across the rest of Asia.\\nSo, our outbound activity from Mainland China to the rest of the world is seeing a significant increase in activity over the past 12 months. We've seen that trend continue in the first quarter of this year. So, a lot of people talk about inward investment into China slowing down. But what I would say is outward investment from China to the rest of the world is actually picking up at quite a pace a very significant pace.\\nWe're very well placed to capture that outflow, and we are capturing that outflow. And our business in Mainland China performed well last year. It's performing well again in the first quarter of this year and its outbound activity is performing extremely well. So, we'll give more updates on that at the half year, but we are capturing that. And that is why actually I think the rest of Asia is performing well on balance sheet because a lot of it is being fed by good intra-Asia activity and outbound from Mainland China.\\nOperator\\nNext question today comes from Katherine Lei at JPMorgan.\\nKatherine Lei\\nI have 3 questions, 3 small questions, actually. The first one is on noninterest income. I look at the breakdown of noninterest income. It seems like wealth is doing quite well. But on Transaction Banking, there is some weakness, I think it's down 9% Y-o-Y. Can we know what is the reason? And how should we triangulate this to the full year? What are the drivers to that? So this is the first one.\\nThe second one is on Hong Kong. With Hong Kong relaxing LTV ratios, I think basically, not only they would be they relax the purchase requirements and the stability requirements on residential properties. So, I think that there is a significant jump in transaction. So, I was thinking that this should be positive to mortgage at least, and then we are a big mortgage providers in Hong Kong.\\nSo, will that have any impact on our outlook in terms of growth, particularly related to Hong Kong? Second one. And then the last one, I think, is on cost. If I look at the first quarter, I think cost is up 8%, including levy. How should I look at this? And then are we on track to the 5% cost growth this year?\\nGeorges Elhedery\\nThank you, Katherine. I'll take question 1 and 3, and I'll hand over to Noel to address your second question about the outlook for Hong Kong. So, first on non-NII.\\nWealth has performed well. Transaction banking weakness is specifically due to foreign exchange. That's driving the whole weakness. And the reason, as I called it out earlier, the reason is that foreign exchange had a record strong quarter 1 '23 on the back of heightened market anxiety and volatility back then due to the banking crisis.\\nSo, therefore, we're doing a comparison to a record quarter, and it will show that drop. But if you look at the number itself, and the revenue itself for foreign exchange, it is back to normalized levels. So, there is nothing to worry about here. It's on the contrary back to normalized levels, and we continue to expect some cyclicality in that space, while we continue expecting growth in the other areas of transaction banking.\\nSo, I wouldn't read more than that into it, and we remain very confident that the investment we're putting both in wealth and transaction banking and in the technology supporting our transaction banking activities do remain strategic focus and bearing results as we look into future quarters and years.\\nOn your third question about cost. So, first, I just want to reiterate, it is a clear priority for us to maintain cost discipline, okay? And we are very confident we will limit cost growth to circa 5%. We will limit cost growth to circa 5% on a target basis.\\nWe're confident about it. And we're actually on track to do so. And the reason why we're kind of on track to do so yet, we showed a 7% quarter 1 growth on a target basis is because of a few idiosyncratic items related to the quarter, which are not repeated in future quarters or some of them will reverse in future quarters. I'll just call the 3 of them out that matter.\\nFirst, there was a 2% accrual of the performance-related pay where we decided to phase that accrual more evenly throughout the year than we did last year. This will manifest in a higher performance-related pay accrual in Q1, hence, the 2% contribution towards the 7%, but it will contribute to lower accrual in future quarters because on a full year basis, we are not accruing to a significantly different number than the full year '23 performance-related pay.\\nSecond, there was 1% contribution from HSBC Innovation Banking this quarter because last year's first quarter, we only acquired SBB in the middle of March, which means we practically didn't have it in the first quarter last year, and that's a base effect.\\nAnd then third, we had the one-offs or the expected nonrecurrence of the FDIC special assessment additional charge this quarter as well as the bank of in levy. Bank of Finland levy is a new charge, which used to be an interest expense as an NII and now it's moved to operations expense as in cost. And between the 2 of them, they contributed to 1%.\\nSo, if you adjust for those and you bake them in, we're still and remain confident to meet our 5% cost target on a full year or circa 5% on a full year basis. On your second question, I'll hand over to Noel.\\nNoel Quinn\\nKatherine, I was in Hong Kong recently and spoke to a number of the market participants there and the developers. And I think firstly, I think the change to the stamp duty arrangements in Hong Kong in March in the budget was very well received, and it's had a positive impact on the activity levels of sales in the Hong Kong market residential sales. It was an extremely significant inflow of activity in the first month. That will be very beneficial to the liquidity positions of many of those developers.\\nWe have to wait and see how that stabilizes because undoubtedly, there was an element of catch up in that first month because people were anticipating some change. Therefore, there was low activity in the preceding months. And then we got to see how that stabilizes. But I think that is a very positive move. It will enhance liquidity within the market. It will enhance activity in the mortgage market. But I think it's too early to call a trend at the moment. I think we need to see how Q2 stabilizes following those changes, but a very helpful intervention.\\nOperator\\nCoombs\\\" type=\\\"A\\\"\\nGeorges Elhedery\\nThank you, Andrew. So the UK NIM was up 6 basis points, indeed, essentially benefited from some idiosyncrasies of structural hedges and timing of structural hedge maturities and reinvestments.\\nSo, if you consider broadly flat to be broadly a range of plus or minus 10 basis points. I would say U.K. NIM has been broadly flat for the last couple of quarters. And we foresee it to remain broadly flat in the next quarter. And you will, therefore, add to that broadly flat, some structural hedge due increases, which will drive you within this plus or minus 10 basis point range.\\nAs regards our loans and deposits have been stable. Again, the U.K. economy has been resilient, we're very optimistic about the outlook for the U.K., specifically around inflation and employment. It remains a very important customer franchise for us. It remains a very important market for us, and we continue gaining market share.\\nI mean, we continue gaining market share in mortgages with a 10% new business market share when our back book now market share has moved or our kind of overall portfolio market shares moved from 7% to 8%. We are a 25% market share in SME lending.\\nAnd obviously, we continue investing in this business. You can look at the ring-fenced bank cost growth and how much we can support cost and investment growth for their infants bank within our overall circa 5% cost growth.\\nSo, all this demonstrates the confidence we have in our business in the U.K., our client activity in the U.K. and the outlook for the U.K. If I move to Argentina, I wish I could give you a trend for Argentina, then the way it works is the numbers balloon with hyperinflation, and then they kind of they shrink with devaluation, and it depends how they manifest themselves over month-over-month.\\nQ4 last year has seen hyperinflation to some level, but they have seen a massive devaluation. If you recall, in December, we've seen more than 50% currency devaluation. That's contributed to a disinflation of the amount that Banking Argentina brought to Q4. And then this quarter is exactly the opposite. We've seen 6% devaluation only, but we've seen 54% inflation, and that will just inflate the numbers.\\nSo, it will be volatile quarter-on-quarter. And our best estimate for the full year is that it may average out to what it averaged out over the last year, which is around EUR 1 billion. Now just looking at the overall Argentina, if you take in the nonbanking NII, you take in the cost base, et cetera, last year's Argentina contribution to our PBT was $0.2 billion. Just to put it in perspective, this is about $0.01 earnings per share or 0.5% dividend per share.\\nTherefore, I think as you look at the full year '24, that's the quantum that Argentina volatility will create. So, it should not distract you from the way you're forecasting the bank's outcomes.\\nAndrew Coombs\\nI guess just to follow up on this. In a scenario whereby you didn't have any devaluation of peso. Inflation was a more moderate normal amount? And what would the NII contribution be under that more kind of BAU scenario a quarter for Argentina?\\nGeorges Elhedery\\nLook, again, it's a difficult one to say. But if you just do the arithmetic of our EUR 1 billion expected for the full year, of which already EUR 0.5 billion has manifested in the first quarter. A smooth out outcome would be the other $0.5 billion phased out evenly over 3 quarters. But that's a highly volatile number. So, I wouldn't use it as a \\u2013 as I said a forecast.\\nOperator\\nThank you, ladies and gentlemen. That ends today's webinar.

I'm joined here in London by Pam. Before Pam takes you through the numbers, I would like to begin with some opening remarks. Overall, there was a strong quarter marked by three key drivers: momentum in our earnings, discipline in our execution, and confidence in our ability to deliver our targets.\\nFirst, we have strong momentum in our business. We had a strong first quarter with profit before tax up 11% and an annualized return on tangible equity of 18.4%, both excluding notable items.\\nWe had our fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in Wealth and attracted net new invested assets of $22 billion as well as another 300,000 new-to-bank customers in Hong Kong, continuing the trend from last year. We also had a strong performance in Transaction Banking, in particular, in FX. And our equities and debt trading businesses, benefiting from higher client activity on the back of higher volatility.\\nSecond, we remain focused on executing our strategy with discipline and are on track to deliver the cost actions we set out in February. We are progressing at pace to deliver on the simplification-related cost saves as well as the strategic cost reallocations. We also continue to take a disciplined approach to our investments and capital allocation to drive growth across our four businesses. We will provide you with a full update on this at the half year results in July.\\nThird, the external macroeconomic environment is less favorable and more uncertain than it was in February as the uncertainty around trade policy dampens business confidence and constrains investment. However, we remain confident in our ability to deliver our targets. Our balance sheet is strong. This is reflected in the deposit surpluses we hold in every major currency in each of our four businesses in every geography in which we operate.\\nThis is why our clients place their trust in us during times of predictability and even more so during times of unpredictability. These provide us with a steady recurring income stream and underpin the lion's share of our banking NII.\\nGrowing our structural hedge has reduced the sensitivity of these revenues to interest rate cuts. Our balance sheet is also underpinned by a strong capital position and a high-quality credit portfolio. We also have resilient recurring fee income from stable floor-based activities in transaction banking and in wealth, with a much smaller contribution from investment banking event-driven business. I encourage you to keep the diversity and quality of our earnings in mind when considering how changes in trade policy will affect our business.\\nOur wholesale transaction banking business covers much broader activities than those related to cross-border trade. And within our trade finance business, we have diverse products, and cover all major global and intra-regional corridors. To assess the impact, higher tariffs could have on our business, We modeled scenarios that contemplate significant but plausible increases in tariffs by the world's largest trading blocks, resulting in a notable slowdown in global trade as well as a slowdown in global GDP growth. In a plausible downside tariff scenario, we estimate that there would be a low single-digit percentage impact on the group's revenues.\\nSeparately, our consensus downside scenario models a slowdown in global trade and GDP growth as a result of an increase in tariffs. The impact of this scenario would be incremental ECLs of $0.5 billion. On this basis, we remain confident in delivering a mid-teens return on tangible equity for 2025, 2026 and 2027 and are reaffirming all of the guidance that we gave in February. We recognize, though, that the broader impacts of the current conditions are more difficult to quantify, and we will continue to monitor these as we formulate our ongoing outlook.

Thank you, everyone, for joining. The momentum in our business has enabled us to deliver a strong first quarter performance headlined by an annualized return on tangible equity of 18.4%, excluding notable items. We had very good underlying profit and revenue performances.\\nCredit remained stable, and we maintained a disciplined approach to cost management. We are pleased to announce a first interim dividend of $0.10 per share and a share buyback of up to $3 billion. The buybacks we completed over the last 12 months have helped take us closer to our target range of 14% to 14.5% CET1. We will continue to return surplus capital to shareholders with buybacks remaining our preferred method. As always, a decision on any share buyback will be made on a quarterly basis. It will depend on organic capital generation and the capital needs of the business.\\nUnpacking the revenue story, excluding notable items, revenue of $17.7 billion was up $1.1 billion on the first quarter of last year, driven by fee and other income. It also included a $0.3 billion increase in debt and equity markets driven by higher volatility and a favorable impact of $0.2 billion in the quarter from the disposal of Argentina, which we completed at the end of last year.\\nOn banking NII, excluding the impact of Argentina, and other notable items, the banking NII run rate remained broadly stable for the -- on the fourth quarter. The impact of interest rate cuts and to fewer days in the quarter were offset by the repricing of liabilities and structural hedge assets and some favorable changes in asset mix.\\nWe continue to expect banking NII of around $42 billion in 2025. As previously stated, this is not an underpin. It remains our expectation at the present time, based on the current market rates outlook and our own projections.\\nMoving to fee and other income. Wholesale transaction banking was up 13% on last year's first quarter. This was driven by a strong FX performance as elevated volatility drove substantial volumes of client hedging activity. Excluding the impact of disposals, Global Payment Solutions was up 3% year-on-year, and Global Trade Solutions was up 6%. In Wealth, the strong momentum from the fourth quarter continued, as we delivered our fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit year-on-year growth.\\nHigh client activity levels in Asia, primarily Hong Kong were the key driver, and there was broad-based growth. We are pleased that the investment we are making in our Wealth products, distribution channels and customer journeys is translating into results. A record new business CSM 301,000 new-to-bank customers in Hong Kong and $22 billion of net new invested assets, $16 billion of which was in Asia. The CSM balance, which is a store of future value was up again this quarter. As you know, the CSM balance is subject to market fluctuations and sensitivities to key indices are in the earning release.\\nOn credit, our first quarter ECL charge of $0.9 billion equivalent to an annualized charge of 37 basis points as a percentage of loans and advances. This included a $150 million provision to reflect heightened economic uncertainty. Excluding this, the first quarter charge was broadly the same as in the first quarter of 2024. The credit risk metrics that we track remains stable, and we continue to monitor them closely. Thinking about the potential impact of tariffs on credit performance, ECLs will be sensitive to macroeconomic performance, the outlook for which remains uncertain. We consider a variety of scenarios as part of our ECL calculation.\\nOne of these is the consensus downside scenario, in which an increase in tariffs results in a global economic slowdown. In this scenario, there would be an incremental ECL charge of around $0.5 billion.\\nOn costs, we are taking a disciplined approach to cost management and are on target to achieve our target of around 3% cost growth in 2025, compared to 2024 on a target basis. We are also on track to deliver $0.3 billion of simplification savings into the P&L in 2025.\\nOn loans and deposits, loan balances were broadly stable quarter-on-quarter, as growth in Corporate and Institutional Banking was offset by the reclassification of our retained French home loan portfolio.\\nDeposits were also broadly stable quarter-on-quarter with a partial reversal of some of the seasonal inflows we saw in Q4. Year-on-year, deposits were up 6% with growth in all entities and businesses. Our CET1 ratio was 14.7%. The reclassification of our retained French home loan portfolio led to a $1.3 billion pretax loss in the quarter, recognized in fair value through other comprehensive income. This had a capital impact of around 0.2 percentage points of CET1.\\nLooking ahead, we expect the buyback we announced today to have an impact of around 0.4 percentage points in the second quarter. You will have seen that BoCom has announced that it has approved a share issuance of up to RMB 120 billion. Upon completion, we expect to recognize an accounting impact dilution loss of between $1.2 billion and $1.6 billion on our stake. This will be treated as a material notable item and will have no material impact on CET1 and no impact on the dividend.\\nLet me end by summarizing. First, we have momentum in our earnings. We had a strong first quarter performance with an annualized return on tangible equity of 18.4%, excluding notable items. We have also continued to perform well in the quarter to date.\\nSecond, we have discipline in our execution. We are on track to deliver the cost actions we set out in February. Third, although the external environment is more uncertain we are confident in our ability to deliver, and we are reaffirming our existing targets and guidance. This includes a mid-teens return on tangible equity in 2025, 2026 and 2027.\\nLouis, can we go to Q&A, please?\",\n","  'topics': ['Credit',\n","   'Market',\n","   'Liquidity & Funding',\n","   'Capital & Leverage',\n","   'Financial Crime'],\n","  'key_insights': ['Strong first quarter performance with an annualized return on tangible equity of 18.4%, excluding notable items.',\n","   'Stable credit risk metrics, with a first quarter ECL charge of $0.9 billion, including a $150 million provision for heightened economic uncertainty.',\n","   'Discipline in cost management with a target of around 3% cost growth in 2025.',\n","   'Potential impact of tariffs on credit performance, with a scenario of an incremental ECL charge of around $0.5 billion.'],\n","  'sentiment': {'label': 'neutral', 'confidence': 0.8},\n","  'risk_flags': [{'name': 'Credit',\n","    'severity': 'medium',\n","    'detail': 'ECL charge of $0.9 billion, including a $150 million provision, reflects heightened economic uncertainty.'},\n","   {'name': 'Financial Crime',\n","    'severity': 'low',\n","    'detail': 'No specific mention of financial crime risks in the provided text.'}],\n","  'kpis': [{'name': 'Return on Tangible Equity',\n","    'value': '18.4% annualized, excluding notable items'},\n","   {'name': 'ECL Charge', 'value': '$0.9 billion for the first quarter'},\n","   {'name': 'Cost Growth Target', 'value': 'Around 3% in 2025'},\n","   {'name': 'CET1 Ratio', 'value': '14.7%'}],\n","  'review_required': False,\n","  'analysis_model': 'phi-4-mini-instruct',\n","  'analysis_latency_s': 13.889},\n"," {'type': 'query',\n","  'person_type': 'participant',\n","  'name': 'Benjamin Toms',\n","  'text': \"Firstly, you mentioned in the release that you've launched a strategic review of Malta, full year results.

Any shift in particularly your kind of corporate customers that might be on the receiving end of trade tariffs?

I guess just two kind of related point to that, one around capital returns. I mean, it's obviously great that you've announced a $3 billion buyback. You're talking about a more subdued outlook for lending by extension RWA. So presumably, you might be quite capital generative this year. So it seems like you're committed to distributions despite the uncertainty, right?

Thank you very much, Aman. I'm going to take your first question about customer behavior, and I'll ask them to address both our capital return strategy as well as the cost redeployment from the reallocations. So in terms of customer behavior, I think nothing that would really surprise you. Corporate customers essentially are in a wait-and-see mode. So some of the CapEx or large investments are on hold. Certainly, some of the shipments from China specifically to the U.S. have slowed down, but we've seen no panic. So there's been no significant drawdowns. There is -- deposit behavior has remained normal. So nothing really to call out beyond the wait and see.\\nIn terms of personal banking and wealth customers activity. Actually, this has been quite strong. And remember, we have a diversified product offering. So we've seen customers rebalance their investments between various offerings and be it various geographic equity exposure or other assets such as mutual funds or structured products. And when customers want to take a risk of approach, we see the money flow into our deposit base, so we kind of capture the customer assets either in invested assets or in deposits. But when we look at our NNIA for the first 3 months of the year, it remained positive, strong. So we remain positive on the outlook of the growth in this business.\\nRemember also, we're investing in this business. So we're capturing the underlying growth in the market, but we're also capturing market share in the way we're embedding in this business.

Let me address your first question on ring-fencing, and Pam will take your second question on the cost. So our view on ring-fencing is that we've taken major -- I mean, there's been major enhancement to the prudential regulations for banks in the U.K. in particular, the broader regimes of capital, of loss absorbency through MREL, liquidity, recovery and resolution, et cetera. All these measures have basically put the bank in a much better safer prudential space that have made ring-fencing effectively redundant.\\nThe second thing to say is that the U.K. is the only major economy that is applied ring-fencing. So it's quite unique to the U.K. So as an outcome, it's increased the cost to operate as a bank. It created capital inefficiencies, it trapped liquidity, it effectively exposed our customers, including businesses and SMEs to higher costs. It did somewhat also stifle competition. The bar to be able to compete in the U.K. for banks has become stiffer and more difficult. So therefore, we believe that removing ring-fencing or at least scaling back on some of the ring-fencing considerations will improve the outcome for customers and ultimately, therefore, will support growth in the U.K.\\nNow just to reiterate, we are very supportive of the government's growth agenda, and we will play our role in the U.K. for that.

Kian, I'm going to make some broad comments on the view of corridors and overall our business. And I'll ask Pam to give you additional information on the tariff scenarios as well as in the cost implications, okay? So a couple of things to note. The first one is as we did say, the lion's share of our banking NII is driven by our deposit franchise. This deposit franchise is a hallmark of our balance sheet. We run 50s loan-to-deposit ratio in three of our four businesses. And in the U.K., we run 80s, which is the lowest. Therefore, we have deposit surpluses in every currency, every geography, every business line, and this franchise is very robust and is a driver of a very important lion's share of our banking NII, very important revenue stream.\\nThe second, when you look at our fee income, when -- so far has continued to grow at double-digit returns, and we do expect it to continue to grow at double-digit returns in the medium term, given the underlying market opportunities and market growth as well as our own investment to continue gaining market share. So transaction banking is the one we really are diving into. Remember, first, transaction banking is a wide set of products that cover various areas outside trade. And remember, a lot of our businesses, let's say, with multinational customers operating in Asia or in China, a lot of their business is in China for China or in Asia for Asia, where they produce and manufacture locally and distribute locally with limited impact on tariffs, albeit some may be impacted by tariffs.\\nBut even within trade, we have seen growth of trade corridors intra-Asia or within Asia, Middle East at a very fast pace. And a number of these corridors have become structurally resilient and on a growth trajectory. Now some of the China Plus One trade patterns that are still meant to ultimately distribute or export to the U.S. will be affected for insofar that there's intra-Asia trade laws for that ultimate purpose. But there is a much bigger Intra-Asia -- Intra-Asia and Middle East trade flows that are 2-way and that are related to domestic manufacturing for the purposes of domestic consumption, which we continue to see as structurally growing.\\nOur scenarios have really looked at differentiation between the areas of structural growth and the areas that will be widely impacted by tariffs, which Pam can talk to.\",\n","  'topics': ['Credit',\n","   'Market',\n","   'IRRBB',\n","   'Liquidity & Funding',\n","   'Capital & Leverage',\n","   'Market – rates, FX, spreads, trading volatility',\n","   'Liquidity & Funding – outflows, deposits, LCR/NSFR',\n","   'Capital & Leverage – CET1, buffers, solvency',\n","   'Market – rates, FX, spreads, trading volatility'],\n","  'key_insights': ['Georges Elhedery highlights the robustness of the deposit franchise, which is a key driver of banking NII and a strong revenue stream.',\n","   'Fee income is expected to continue growing at double-digit rates, driven by market opportunities and strategic investments.',\n","   'Transaction banking is expanding, particularly in intra-Asia and Middle East trade corridors, which are showing structural growth.'],\n","  'sentiment': {'label': 'positive', 'confidence': 0.9},\n","  'risk_flags': [{'name': 'Market – rates, FX, spreads, trading volatility',\n","    'severity': 'low',\n","    'detail': 'Intra-Asia and Middle East trade corridors are growing, but some China Plus One trade patterns may be affected by tariffs.'}],\n","  'kpis': [{'name': 'Banking NII driven by deposit franchise',\n","    'value': '50s loan-to-deposit ratio in three businesses, 80s in the U.K.'},\n","   {'name': 'Fee income growth',\n","    'value': 'Double-digit returns expected to continue in the medium term'}],\n","  'review_required': False,\n","  'analysis_model': 'phi-4-mini-instruct',\n","  'analysis_latency_s': 12.582},\n"," {'type': 'answer',\n","  'person_type': 'presenter',\n","  'name': 'Manveen Kaur',\n","  'text': \"So thank you, Kian. So firstly, just to reiterate, the $40 billion banking NII continues to be our best estimate for full year 2025. Now we've looked at a range of reasonable upside, downside assumptions, including rates, but we are not immune to all scenarios despite the stress work that we have done. Our Q1 run rate of $10.6 billion puts us on a good trajectory given that range of scenarios you've looked at all plausible upsides and downsides.\\nNow as always, there are four key drivers. The rates that we have included are based on the mid-April curves. The structural hedge will be a tailwind to this headwind of rates. We have $75 billion maturities in the remainder of the year, and they are on 2.8% yield at the moment. So there will be an upside to that.\\nThe other two elements are harder to forecast, particularly in terms of balance sheet growth, as we've said before, and the loans stay muted. Having said that, loans and advances were slightly up in the first quarter of this year, primarily because Hong Kong loans and advances were stable compared to Q4 last year where they had conducted. Now the deposit migration trend from Hong Kong has stayed stable over last year into this year at 39%, and that is continuing even through April. So if I look at it in the round in terms of deposit behaviors of our customers, both from a corporate side and as well as from a retail side, we stay quite comfortable.\\nSo on tariffs, just in terms of the broad piece, what we have looked at from a tariff perspective is, and it's all in terms of seeing the various scenarios in terms of delivering the mid-teens RoTE. I mean, firstly, we looked at our income stream beyond banking NII, which is wholesale transaction banking. And it has many more products beyond trade finance. It also is in diverse products within trade finance and their diverse global and intra-regional corridors. Now when we have looked to the downside scenario, we've looked at higher tariffs. We have looked at impact on GDP. And we have looked more broadly on policy rates, inflation, the big picture.\\nBut again, to say we have not looked at GDP to the stress level of a downside 2 scenario that we have called out in our release, which is like a double-digit contraction of GDP as we saw in the COVID period. So if you look at all that, we come to a low single-digit percentage impact on revenues. And within that and within the incremental $500 million ECLs, we stay very confident for our mid-teens RoTE for the next 3 years.\\nNow the broader impacts are going to be hard to quantify. These are your second, third order impacts, but we'll continue to monitor them through our various scenarios and review them quarter-on-quarter. On costs, our cost trajectory is on track. And given this, there's no shift on that. And we will still continue through our envelope to be able to invest in the areas which we have been, as Georges has said, because we can see the direct benefit coming very quickly in those areas even in the current environment and continuing through April, and that's primarily on the well side.\",\n","  'topics': ['Interest Rate Risk', 'Liquidity & Funding', 'Credit', 'Market'],\n","  'key_insights': ['Banking NII remains strong at $40 billion for 2025, with a Q1 run rate of $10.6 billion.',\n","   'Structural hedge and $75 billion maturities on 2.8% yield provide a positive outlook despite rate headwinds.',\n","   'Deposit migration from Hong Kong stable at 39%, indicating customer retention and liquidity stability.'],\n","  'sentiment': {'label': 'neutral', 'confidence': 0.8},\n","  'risk_flags': [{'name': 'Interest Rate Risk',\n","    'severity': 'medium',\n","    'detail': 'Exposure to interest rate changes could impact profitability.'},\n","   {'name': 'Liquidity & Funding',\n","    'severity': 'low',\n","    'detail': 'Stable deposit migration suggests good liquidity position.'}],\n","  'kpis': [{'name': 'Banking NII', 'value': '$40 billion estimate for 2025'},\n","   {'name': 'Q1 Run Rate', 'value': '$10.6 billion'},\n","   {'name': 'Deposit Migration', 'value': '39% stable'}],\n","  'review_required': False,\n","  'analysis_model': 'phi-4-mini-instruct',\n","  'analysis_latency_s': 10.735},\n"," {'type': 'query',\n","  'person_type': 'participant',\n","  'name': 'Amit Goel',\n","  'text': \"Potentially follow-up, actually, to Kian's question.

Again, just coming back in terms of the broader profitability mid-teens kind of target. So essentially, you're saying that if we were to see that plausible downside scenario, you still believe you can achieve that mid-teens profitability level and that's before factoring in any further kind of cost actions. Or would that be with any kind of rejigging or additional cost action taken by the group to mitigate some of that impact?\\nAnd then secondly, I just wanted to check, when I look at the downside 1 ECL scenario now versus a full year, it seems like the China and Hong Kong drawdown is not quite as severe. I see the U.S. is maybe a little bit 30 bps more severe.

There can be credit downgrades over a period of time. I saw a few now, but the impact from an RWA perspective is very modest. If you look from a U.S. perspective, also there was a specific name.

The actions taken typically is when you have colleagues put through at risk and decisions made, communicated. There is always a time lag typically between that and colleagues leaving the platform. Typically, it tends to be about 1/4, 90 days.

Katherine, I'm going to make some comments on your first question, and I'll ask Pam then to take it forward as well as the loan growth question, which gives you an overlook. So firstly, we recognize indeed, there is a lot of potential for China to take policy measures and other measures to stimulate the economy, and we would be very encouraged by that. We're confident about the outlook for China. We're optimistic that these measures as they are taken and they will be taken will have a positive impact on the economy. We believe in the foundational strength of the Chinese economy, and we're very encouraged to see the pickup in the retail sales, and therefore, the pickup in domestic consumption also.\\nSo on the whole, our main scenario is that we are confident in the medium- to long-term outlook in China. This being said, in a plausible adverse downside scenario, we have not taken into account some of these potential positive impacts, which may be or not likely to come.

Thanks, Katherine. So absolutely being a stress downside scenario plausible, but severe, we typically take the downside. We don't take the upside of the mitigating actions or any other policy measures. It's purely tariffs and evaluatory tariffs in a plausible range. So all said and done, I just want to reaffirm, it was all calculated as part of the target RoTE guidance that we are giving.\\nOn loan growth, the situation is in some ways similar to where we were at the end of Q4, because macroeconomic uncertainty delays decision-making. So we are not seeing any of those CapEx decisions being brought forward or delayed. They were delayed. They will continue to be delayed hopefully at some stage when some certainty remains, there will be loan growth. We are also monitoring very closely to see if there is any increase in drawdowns just like we observed in Q2 of 2020.\\nAt this point of time, there's no increase in drawdowns. So overall, from a loan growth perspective, I would say, still muted in terms of what we are seeing. The only thing I would say is that, if there is sort of continued tariff uncertainty, you will see maybe a little bit pickup from a OpEx perspective on working capital, because when you have to pay import duties upfront and there's some delays in some of the monies coming and so on. So that's kind of will have an impact.\\nBut from a materiality perspective, the real driver for our banking NII guidance of $42 billion is really deposits for which we have a very strong franchise. We are in a privileged position to be a trusted partner for our customers, and we expect that to grow. Of course, there will be a bit of seasonal fluctuation quarter-on-quarter.

So yes, indeed, customer -- I mean, look, first, the customers aren't taking any decisions in panic, customers essentially are in wait and see mode. Number of CapEx or large investments have been slowed down and certainly trade between China and the U.S., we've seen a major slowdown. But on the whole, customers are looking at their business models. They are looking at their supply chains. They're looking at ways to create more resilience in their business. And we're definitely here to help them.\\nAs I said earlier, we are our customers' trusted banking partner. They trust the strength of our financial strength, the strength of our balance sheet and our proposition. They trust the stability of our commitments to support them through their needs and through all predictable and unpredictable times.\\nAnd very importantly, they trust our expertise. We have more than 5,000 trade experts in more than 50 jurisdictions, working with clients to help them think through what this means for their business model and now how they can help them adapt and adjust and create resilience. So therefore, in an environment like this one, we expect to deepen relationships with clients. We expect to acquire new clients and to consolidate our position as a leading trade bank and we expect to make, hopefully, a difference for our customers in navigating these uncertainties. Thank you very much, Ian.\\nI think we have addressed all the questions. So I want to take this opportunity to thank all of you for your questions. So looking in closing, we had a strong quarter marked by momentum in our earnings, discipline in our execution and confidence in our ability to deliver our targets.\\nNeil and the team are available for any follow-up questions with our Investor Relations expert.

For your information, this conference is being recorded.\\nAt this time, I will hand the call over to your host, Mr. Douglas Flint, Group Chairman.\\nDouglas Flint\\nThank you very much. Good morning from London, good afternoon in Hong Kong, and welcome to the 2016 HSBC annual results call.\\nWith me today are Stuart Gulliver, Group Chief Executive; and Iain MacKay, the Group Finance Director. And before we start, I'd like to say a word on behalf of the board.\\nHSBC's performance in 2016 was broadly satisfactory against the backdrop of far-reaching geopolitical and economic developments. Operating performance in the second half of the year was much stronger than expected as businesses and financial markets responded more optimistically than predicted. The board was happy with the traction from management actions to reshape the group and address the challenges of the continuing low-interest rate environment, and these actions are bearing fruit through market share gains, greater cost efficiency and improved performance. Much of the heavy investments in reshaping the group to improve productivity embrace technological change, and reinforce global standards of business conduct has been made.\\nWe entered 2017 with the restructuring of the group essentially completed and with a strong capital position and a conservative balance sheet.\\nWe delivered in our commitments in maintaining the annual dividend in respect of the year at $0.51 as we indicated at the interim stage, and this was delivered through the declaration today of a fourth interim dividend of $0.21.\\nIn addition to this, the board has determined to return to shareholders up to a further $1 billion, by way of a share buyback.\\nLet me hand over now to Stuart to talk through the key points before Iain takes a more detailed look at our performance. Stuart?\\nStuart Gulliver\\nThanks, Douglas. So turning to Slide 2. We made good progress in 2016. The implementation of our strategic actions is actually well-advanced and our global universal business model performed well in challenging conditions.\\nThe drop in the reported profit before tax reflected a number of significant items. The noncash items included a $3.2 billion write-off of goodwill in Global Private Banking in Europe and fair value losses on our own debt of $1.8 billion.\\nThe cash items included $3.1 billion investment in our cost-reduction programs, $680 million related to legal settlements and provisions and $559 million related to U.K. customer redress. The reported number also includes a $1.7 billion accounting loss on the sale of our Brazil business.\\nOur adjusted profits were broadly unchanged year-on-year, following solid performances by our global businesses. These enabled us to capture market share in strategic product areas and build a platform for future growth. We delivered positive adjusted jaws in 2016.\\nGlobal Banking Markets recovered from a sector-wide slow start to the year to generate higher adjusted revenue than 2015. Commercial Banking performed well, particularly in the U.K. and Hong Kong, growing revenue in spite of a slowdown in global trade.\\nThe Retail Banking and Wealth Management performance was mixed. Overall revenue was down compared to 2015 due largely to the impact of reduced client activity in Hong Kong on our Wealth Management businesses. However, strong mortgage growth and higher currency accounts and savings balances helped to increase revenue in Retail Banking. And we've written off all the remaining goodwill in the European Private Banking business. This goodwill relates principally to the original purchase of Safra Republic Holdings in 1999. The restructuring of Global Private Banking is now largely complete, and although Global Private Banking is now much smaller than it was 3 years ago, it is deliberately positioned for sustainable growth with a focus on serving the personal wealth management needs of the leadership and owners of the group's corporate clients. This was reflected in 2016 through solid revenue growth from group-referred relationships. We also continue to make strong progress on our strategic actions to improve returns and gain maximum value from our international network.\\nMeanwhile, our targeted reduction of risk weighted assets is now 97% complete, and we expect to exceed our reduction target by the end of 2017.\\nOur cost-reduction programs continue to bring down our adjusted operating expenses. The traction that these programs have gained in the last 18 months has enabled us to increase the amount of cost that we're able to remove from the business. We now expect to deliver annualized savings of around $6 billion by the end of 2017, about $1 billion above our original target, and we'll invest in equivalent amounts of around $6 billion over the same time frame to achieve this.\\nImproved lending and deposit balances, interest rate rises and better collaboration between businesses helped generate significantly higher profits in our Mexico business year-on-year and significant market share gains, particularly in consumer lending.\\nWe also continued to build our business in Asia Pacific, launching our first exclusively HSBC-branded credit card in Mainland China, growing assets under management and insurance new business premiums and seeing the first lines of growth in our loan book in the Pearl River Delta. We also extended our leadership with the offshore renminbi bond market to achieve our best ranking for China outbound mergers and acquisitions since 2003.\\nWe also completed the $2.5 billion share buyback in December that we commenced at the half year. We are today announcing a second buyback of up to $1 billion to retire more of the capital that previously supported the Brazil business. Having received the appropriate regulatory clearances, we aim to complete this new buyback in the first half of 2017. This will bring the total value of shares repurchased since last August to USD 3.5 billion.\\nOur strong common equity tier 1 ratio of 13.6% reinforces our ability to invest in the business, support the dividend and consider future share buybacks and manage the continuing uncertain regulatory environment.\\nIain will talk you through the numbers.\\nIain Mackay\\nThanks, Stuart. As you may already know, we have recemented our results with the Global businesses now representing our primary reporting segments and have replaced the business line known as Other with Corporate Center to better reflect the way we manage our business. Corporate Center comprises Central Treasury, including Balance Sheet Management, our legacy businesses, interest in associates and joint ventures, central stewardship costs that support the business and the U.K. bank levy. There are more details on the Corporate Center in the appendix. Our published recementation book would also provide detailed analysis and reconciliation to this reporting change.\\nLooking quickly at some key metrics for 2016, the reported return on average ordinary shareholder's equity was 0.8%. The reported return on average tangible equity was 2.6%. On an adjusted basis, we had positive jaws of 1.2%, and we had tangible net asset value per ordinary share of $6.92. The movement in jaws was due to a 3.7% reduction in adjusted operating expenses, which exceeded the 2.5% fall in adjusted revenue in 2016. Our adjusted measure includes the impact of the bank levy.\\nTangible net asset value fell by $0.45 in the fourth quarter, driven largely by foreign currency exchange differences and movements in available-for-sale investment through other comprehensive income. There's more detail on these movements in the appendix.\\nSlide 4 shows the impact of significant items in currency translation in the fourth quarter on our reported profits and on our return on equity. The largest significant items in Q4 were noncash items, namely the $2.4 billion write-off of the remaining goodwill of the European Global Private Banking business and $1.6 billion arising from changes in credit spreads on our own debt designated at fair value. We also included a $1.1 billion of investment to achieve our cost savings.\\nAdjusted profit before tax for the fourth quarter was up 39% year-on-year. Adjusted profits for the full year were broadly stable. Our return on equity was 0.8% and our return on tangible equity was 2.6% for 2016, both adversely impacted by significant items. Excluding these items and the bank levy, our return on equity was 7.7% and the return on tangible equity was 8.5%.\\nSlide 5 provides more detail on the items that take us from reported to adjusted for both the fourth quarter and the full year. You will find more details of these adjustments in the appendix, and the remainder of the presentation focuses on adjusted numbers.\\nSlide 6 looks at fourth quarter profit before tax. Adjusted profit before tax was $738 million higher than the fourth quarter of 2015 driven by significantly lower loan impairment charges and continued robust cost management. The decrease in revenue is due predominantly to adverse valuation differences on long-term debt and associated swaps caused by sharp interest rate rises in the fourth quarter. The negative impact of these valuation differences was $742 million, compared to a negative impact of $126 million in the same period last year. The full year negative impact of this difference was $278 million.\\nWe did not forecast this for revenue purposes as we hedge these bonds over their duration and the short-term valuation differences are not meaningful. There are more details on this in the appendix. Against this, were our strong performances in Global Banking and Markets and Commercial Banking.\\nSlide 7 looks at revenue. Fourth quarter revenue from our Global businesses was $605 million higher than the last year's fourth quarter. I'll go through each business in more detail in the next few slides.\\nThe $944 million reduction in revenue of Corporate Center between the third and fourth quarters was mainly caused by the valuation difference in long-term debt and associated swaps that I've already described. Reported revenue numbers include a $396 million impact associated with foreign currency translation differences versus the third quarter. On an annual basis, our Global businesses revenue was broadly unchanged.\\nSlide 8 looks at Retail Banking and Wealth Management revenue. Revenue increased by $25 million compared to last year's fourth quarter, increased customer lending and higher deposits throughout 2016 helped grow fourth quarter Retail Banking revenue by $66 million. Wealth Management revenue also grew by $40 million, driven by investment distribution in Asia. Lending growth accelerated in the fourth quarter, particularly in mortgages in Hong Kong and the U.K. For the full year, adjusted revenue was down 2% as 1% growth in Retail Banking revenue was more than offset by a fall in Wealth Management. This was principally caused by the impact of our investment business that reduced client activity in Hong Kong, particularly in the first half of the year.\\nAs Slide 9 shows, Commercial Banking revenue was broadly stable compared to last year's fourth quarter. We continue to see strong balance sheet growth in the fourth quarter with $6 billion of additional lending and a further $11 billion of deposits. This contributed to a 5% revenue increase in Global Liquidity and Cash Management compared to last year's fourth quarter.\\nTLAC costs and the impact of market movements in Asia on insurance revenue caused revenue in Other to fall by 16%. For the full year, Commercial Banking revenue grew $534 million or 1%. This included growth in Global Liquidity and Cash Management of $181 million, driven by increased balances and wider spreads in Hong Kong. Credit and lending also increased by $83 million, reflecting continued loan growth in the U.K. These were partly offset by lower revenue in Global Trade and Receivables Finance.\\nGlobal Banking and Markets had a strong fourth quarter, increasing revenue by 23% year-on-year. Foreign exchange, rates, banking and global liquidity and cash management all grew revenue, capitalizing an increased client flows and market movements.\\nFor the full year, Global Banking and Markets revenue rose by $353 million or 2% compared to 2015. This included a net negative impact of $297 million related to adverse movements in credits and funding valuation adjustments.\\nExcluding these movements, revenue rose by $650 million or 5%, mainly in rates and credit, as we paid market share in Europe. Revenue also increased in Global Liquidity and Cash Management as we grew average balances and benefited from wider spreads. This was a good performance from Global Banking and Markets in 2016. Since 2014, adjusted risk-weighted assets in Global Banking and Markets have fallen by 14%, and adjusted revenue have risen by 10%. This demonstrated the effectiveness of both our risk-weighted asset reduction program and our targeted investment in the business.\\nSlide 11 looks at Global Private Banking, which saw a fall in revenue of $43 million or 10% compared to last year's fourth quarter. This largely reflected the continued repositioning of the business and reduced market activity.\\nDuring 2016, we disposed our private banking businesses in Bermuda and Brazil and a client portfolio in Europe. These disposals are reflected in the fall in client assets during the period. The repositioning of Global Private Banking is now substantially complete.\\nFor the full year, adjusted revenue fell by $208 million or 11%. We attracted more than $5 billion of net new money from collaborations by global business customers in 2016. Corporate Center revenue fell by $944 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. This was principally due to a net $616 million reduction from adverse valuation differences on long-term debt and associated swaps, and the loss of revenue from the run-off of our U.S. CML portfolio. Balance Sheet Management revenue rose by $133 million or 21% against last year's fourth quarter. Balance Sheet Management for the full year was up by $175 million or 7%. We reduced the remaining U.S. run-off portfolio by 49%, which contributed $8 billion of the $22 billion RWA reduction in the fourth quarter. We expect to complete the disposal of the CML assets during 2017.\\nFull year net interest margin of 173 -- 1.73%, sorry, was 15 basis points lower than 2015. 8 of those basis points came from the disposal of our operations in Brazil and currency translation differences, particularly in the U.K. and Mexico. The remainder came largely from lower yields in customer lending, including revenue lost from the run-off of our U.S. CML portfolio and an increase in the cost of debt, including around $400 million of TLAC interest costs.\\nSlide 14 looks at operating expenses. Our operating expenses, excluding the bank levy, increased by 5% from the prior fiscal quarter, reflecting a small number of specific items, and these included a write-off of around $150 million relating to software that we no longer use and a spending increase related to marketing programs launched in the fourth quarter.\\nOur cost performance in 2016 was excellent with a $1.2 billion or 4% drop in adjusted operating expenses. We removed $2.2 billion of costs from the business in 2016, bringing a total annualized run rate savings since we started our cost savings program to around $3.7 billion.\\nOur U.K. bank levy charge was $499 million lower than 2015, including a positive adjustment of $128 million relating to previous year. These reductions were partially offset by the impact of inflation and further investment in regulatory programs and compliance.\\nOur total expenditure in regulatory programs and compliance was $3 billion, which was around $4 million or 14% higher than in 2015. We expect an increase of more than 10% in regulatory and compliance costs in 2017.\\nSlide 15 walks you from 2014 operating expenses to a revised 2017 exit run rate target. While we are investing more in regulatory and compliance programs, we're also continuing to invest in growth and improvements in the business. We will more than pay for this investment through additional cost savings, which will require additional one-off investments to remove these costs from the business. We've already invested around 90% of the amount that we originally said we would by the end of 2017 to achieve our target cost savings and improve the operating capabilities and productivity of the group.\\nWe now expect to invest a total of around $6 billion by the end of 2017 to achieve total run rate cost savings of around $6 billion, around $1 billion above the top end of our Investor Day target range.\\nSlide 16 looks at loan impairment charges. Fourth quarter LICs were down $83 million from the third quarter of 2016, down $825 million compared to fourth quarter of 2015. Fourth quarter LICs for 2016 had no outstanding features, and the credit outlook remains benign. There is no small -- there is no small part due to the strength of our risk management and portfolio repositioning since 2011.\\nIn 2016, as a whole, loan impairment charges were $48 million higher than 2015 due to a small number of individually assessed LICs in Global Banking and Markets, raising oil and gas and mining sectors in the U.S. in the first half of the year. There were also higher charges in Retail Banking and Wealth Management, particularly in Mexico as we grew our market share of retail and consumer banking products. These entries were mostly offset by a large reduction in Commercial Banking charges.\\nSlide 17 breaks down adjusted profit for 2016 by global business and geography. The overall story is unchanged since the third quarter. Adjusted profit before tax was down by $228 million or 1% due to lower revenue and marginally higher loan impairment charges, but this was largely offset by good progress in costs. The effectiveness of our cost-reduction program means that we achieved positive jaws of 1.2% in 2016 in spite of a tough revenue environment.\\nWe generated a further $38 billion of risk-weighted asset reductions in the fourth quarter, bringing total reductions for the year to $142 billion. $17 billion of the fourth quarter total came from Global Banking and Markets and legacy credit. $8 billion came from our U.S. CML one-off portfolios, $5 billion from Commercial Banking and $8 billion from other, mainly in Balance Sheet Management. The total reduction since the start of 2015 now stands at $267 billion, around 44% of which came from Global Banking and Markets and legacy credit. This takes us more than 97% of the way towards our target, which we expect to exceed through continued focus on efficient capital deployment.\\nTurning to capital, the group's common equity tier 1 ratio was 13.6% in 31 December, compared with 13.9% at the end of the third quarter. Common equity tier 1 capital reduced by $9 billion in the fourth quarter, due mainly to foreign exchange movements, dividends and reported loss for the period. Impact of this reduction in our common equity tier 1 ratio was mitigated by the reduction in risk-weighted assets. Today's buyback announcement reduces common equity tier 1 ratio to 13.5%.\\nSlide 20 looks to the year ahead. Our financial targets maintain our focus on improving returns, delivering cost productivity consistently and providing sustainable returns to shareholders. Our medium-term revenue prospects remain good, supported by loan growth and strong deposit growth in 2016 and steeper yield curves and rising interest rates in the U.S. and Hong Kong.\\nOur restructured business is increasingly well-positioned to capture further opportunities, and our Global businesses [indiscernible] momentum from the fourth quarter into the start of 2017. We have traction in our cost management and productivity improvement programs with persistent focus in improving returns supported by continued commitment to capital efficiency.\\nUncertainty in the geopolitical and regulatory environments were main considerations. There are also a number of near-term revenue headwind that are worth bearing in mind. Restating 2016 reported revenues based on average January 2017 foreign exchange rates would reduce them by $2 billion. Clearly, costs benefited from such FX movements.\\nWe expect around $500 million of additional TLAC interest costs in 2017 and a potential $300 million revenue impact from lower U.K. interest rates.\\nIt's also worth remembering that while the run-off of our U.S. CML legacy portfolio is clearly good news, we will lose the revenue associated with the assets that we sell as well as the associated impairment losses.\\nI'll now hand back to Stuart.\\nStuart Gulliver\\nThanks, Iain. So Slide 21 shows our progress [indiscernible] actions we outlined at our investor update in June 2015. We're now 18 months into a 2.5-year program, and a large majority of actions remain on track. We're going to beat our original targets to reduce both risk-weighted assets and costs, as Iain has already said.\\nMexico also continues to recover strongly, adjusted PBT more than tripled in 2016 and revenue grow 18% year-on-year. We grew lending by 14%, increasing our market share of personal loans, payroll loans and mortgages and raising our advances to deposit ratio. We also grew Global Trade, Receivables Finance and Global Liquidity and Cash Management revenues in Mexico by 11% and 19%, respectively.\\nThe low-interest rate environment, however, continued to keep the U.S. business off-track, although adjusted revenues in Global Banking and Markets and Retail Banking and Wealth Management both grew in 2016. The network benefits of the U.S. business have also increased as we grew revenue from the international subsidiaries of our U.S. clients by 11% compared with 2015.\\nThe establishment of the U.K. ring-fenced bank remains on track. Both the chair and CEO positions of HSBC U.K. have now been filled, following the announcements of Clara Furse as Chair and Ian Stuart as Chief Executive.\\nThe migration of roles from London to Birmingham is around 35% complete, with the remainder on track to be in place by the time the bank launches in 2018. Our international network continued to drive revenue growth in our transaction banking product lines. Level of liquidity in Cash Management revenue increased by 6% year-on-year, and Global Trade and Receivables Finance captured further market share in strategic markets, including Hong Kong and Singapore.\\nIn 2016, we were named Best Bank for Corporates by Euromoney and Best Supply Chain Finance Bank at the Trade Finance Awards.\\nWe continue to invest for growth in Asia. We launched a new digital banking platform for SMEs in Guangdong, a growing business around the China-led Belt and Road initiative, and we were named Asia's Best Investment Bank and Asia's Best Bank for Financing by Euromoney. Assets under management in Asia increased by 11%, and we grew revenue from the international subsidiaries of our ASEAN region commercial banking clients.\\nWe continue to be the leading bank for international renminbi products and services, and we're better protected from financial crime because of our investments in our Global Standards program. Our Monitor has raised certain concerns, but we will continue to progress and our commitment remains unwavering.\\nBy the end of this year, we're on track to have our AML and sanctions policy framework in place and to have introduced major compliance IT systems across the group. Beyond 2017, we will continue to work to fine-tune those systems and ensure that our improvements are fully integrated into our day-to-day risk management practices.\\nSo to conclude, I'd like to leave you with 4 points. First, our strategy is working. Our global businesses are performing well in challenging operating conditions. Our international network, our main differentiator, is delivering more than 45% of client revenue. We're capturing market share in strategic areas. We have an unrivaled business in Asia with strong returns and good momentum. And we've delivered positive adjusted jaws in 2016, and we expect to do this again in 2017.\\nSecond, we're doing what we've said we'd do. We're going to exceed both our original risk-weighted asset and cost reduction targets. We sold our Brazil business, which allowed us to complete the first share buyback in our history and to announce today a second buyback of $1 billion. Our Mexico business is being turned around quickly and effectively, and our investment in Asia is delivering more revenue for the group in strategic areas.\\nThird, more than ever, there's a big advantage in being a diversified global bank. The complexity of the current environment and the potential difficulty in connecting customers with strong growth opportunities, naturally benefits the bank with our network and heritage. The world is evolving into big regional trading blocks with less global trade, with vastly increased regional trade in the areas where barriers are falling fastest are the regions where HSBC is strongest. Our long-standing and growing, strength in infrastructure and project financing in Asia and Europe also positioned us perfectly to capitalize on opportunities arriving from the China-led Belt and Road initiative and the rising prominence of green finance.\\nFinally, we remain a well-funded business with strong capital generation, a diversified balance sheet and an excellent record of delivering value for shareholders. Last year, we delivered a total shareholder return of 36% in Hong Kong dollars, while building a common equity tier 1 ratio of 13.6%. We've maintained the dividend in 2016 and we're confident doing so for the foreseeable future.\\nWe're now happy to take questions. The operator will explain the procedure, and introduce the first question. Operator?\\nOperator\\n[Operator Instructions] We will now take our first question from Ronit Ghose from Citigroup.\\nRonit Ghose\\nCan I just pick up on a couple of points relating to revenues? Q4 seems to be a bit of disappointment, vis-a-vis market expectation, maybe just better forecasting. But you're highlighting lots of 2017 challenges, while talking up the medium term. And if you can just dig into this please, on specifically the growth outlook, you say you're very well-positioned -- you're well-positioned for growth in Asia. Loan growth is running at about 4% right now in Asia for you. Do you expect that run rate to accelerate from 4%? In your statements, you've mentioned some of the leading indicators, macro indicators are picking up, trade is picking up. Yet it's pretty uncertain in terms of outlook. So I'm just wondering if that kind of 4% revenue sort of loan growth -- 4% loan growth can be stronger in your Asian footprint this year. Linked to that on the revenues, the margins -- is most of the margin, the underlying margin weakness that you've seen in Q4, down to loan spreads coming down? And how much more sort of pressure do you expect on the spread in the U.K. and the U.S., particularly in the U.K? And finally, on the one-offs, the -- there's a $1 billion swing in treasury that Iain obviously called out. And I'm just curious as to why you're not putting that into the one-offs. And can you say that you expect this to kind of net to 0 over time? How should we try to think about that treasury revenue number?\\nIain Mackay\\nThere's a loss in here. I think from -- I mean, Stuart can provide some context on this. We clearly don't include based on loan growth coming through our Global Banking and Markets, and we saw encouragement coming through retail bank as well in the fourth quarter of last year with some momentum coming into 2017. But I think the growth rates that you referred to, Ronit, around 4% to 5%, are probably in line with what we are presently seeing and what we would expect to see through 2017 in that particular area. Moving on to margins, there are a couple of factors coming through in the fourth quarter. You will notice, and we commented here, that again you got accelerated reductions in our U.S. CML run-off portfolio in the fourth quarter and notwithstanding that, that historically has been a loss-making portfolio. It is a very strong NIM portfolio, and as we continue to sell and run-off those assets, that feeds through to NIM. The other factor that we saw in the fourth quarter was the impact really of the MIL [ph] or TLAC, depending on what you want to call it, coming through in the fourth quarter, having issued last year over $31 billion worth of instruments into the marketplace to meet those regulatory requirements. And another factor that was an influence in the fourth quarter was the impact of the bank rate reduction earlier in the year. That was certainly reflected in the fourth quarter. And I think those are probably 2 of the main features that come through in that regard. FX, again, quite a [indiscernible].\\nStuart Gulliver\\nImpact coming from the weakness in Mexican peso and Chinese renminbi, the Egyptian pound and, of course, the U.K. pound, which also, if you translate them into U.S. dollars, has a sort of negative impact. And loans and advances actually grew quite strongly in the fourth quarter, which is to say is why we can see some revenue growth, but not above that 4%, 5% handle. The specific thing that caused a lot of the miss against honest estimates in the revenue line is specifically around debt issued, and Iain you should just talk about that a little bit as to, as you say, why it's not in significant items.\\nIain Mackay\\nYes, if you look at the total year impact, we have a number of long-dated bonds outstanding, part of the overall funding structure for the group. And those are matched by interest rate swaps. So those are fixed-rate instruments, hedged, swapped into floating because majority of our book is floating-rate and they are matched economically across the duration. What we clearly saw, some of the longer-dated bonds, as what we saw in the fourth quarter, is we saw a little bit of winding in the valuation curve. So the bond is valued off a LIBOR curve and the swap by convention is valued off the overnight Index swap rate. And there's a little bit of divergence that came through in that regard, which impacted more in the fourth quarter than have been over the course of the year. If you look to the total year, the impact was less -- it was about $200 million, $270 million for the full year impact. We haven't historically seen a great deal of volatility coming through this, and we don't really do anything particular from a forecasting perspective for the reasons that I described, is that if you hold these bonds and the economic hedge swap against them due to maturity, the impact should broadly migrate towards 0. This has really been a relatively insignificant feature within the P&L and within the revenue line over recent quarters, and it was really part of that yield -- the current yield that we saw in the second half year that largely influenced it. Whether we reclassify this going forward, I think, will largely depend on the volatility that we see coming through this. But to be clear, we'll provide insight to it when we do see it coming through every quarter.\\nRonit Ghose\\nCan I just have a quick supplementary on the RBWM revenues? You called out as well you mentioned there's a weakness in Wealth. Is that client activity or is that sort of the traditional life insurance type returns, it's like an investment return weakness in the first quarter? Is that client volumes slowing in the fourth quarter?\\nStuart Gulliver\\nNo, it's actually the first half. And actually, it was an incredibly strong first half of 2015, it's Hong Kong Shanghai stock connect, and then remember that first quarter 2016 was a really slow start and quite difficult for everything related to capital markets, generally. That created weakness in the first quarter first half in Wealth Management, particularly in Hong Kong, and the second half never made it back up.\\nRonit Ghose\\nBut it looks like -- maybe I misread it, but it looks like Q3 was really strong and Q4 was a bit weaker, a couple of hundred million weaker quarter-on-quarter in Hong Kong Wealth or in [indiscernible] Wealth.\\nStuart Gulliver\\nNo, I think what we saw coming through was fairly good numbers from a Retail Banking perspective rather than the wealth piece. So Hong Kong there's big growth in deposits [indiscernible] deposits in the Retail Banking space.\\nIain Mackay\\nYes, and I think what we also see seasonally within the Asian business, with Hong Kong in particular, is a little bit of repositioning around the end of the year. So from an investment distribution perspective, the revenue was down slightly in the fourth quarter versus the third, but nothing of particular note.\\nOperator\\nOur next question today comes from Alastair Ryan from Bank of America.\\nAlastair Ryan\\n[indiscernible] So the net interest margin, just coming back to that, is 1.75% in the first half, 1.73% for the full year. How should we think about sort of the exit run rate and how quickly the December dollar rate hike starts to outweigh the earlier in 2016 rate cuts in place around the U.K? Second, Iain, just on your comments on the CML. Now you're quite clear you hope to be out of that in 2017. Did I understand correctly that the entities will be gone as well then, because, clearly, in the past, they have been a big consumer of stress test capital for you? And thirdly, just on your comment on Slide 20, an encouraging start to the year. Can I encourage you to quantify encouraging?\\nIain Mackay\\nOkay, so I'll start. On NIM, just going back, taking the fourth quarter discrete where NIM in the fourth quarter was 160 basis points. Now if you take out the annualized effect of Brazil, on a year-to-date basis during the third quarter, you take out the annualized effect of Brazil, that's 10 basis points. You then have about a 5 or 6 basis point move between the third quarter and the fourth quarter. That's contributed to buyout a little bit of asset compression coming through U.K. mortgages. So what we clearly saw last year was a pretty competitive environment for U.K. mortgages. We competed in that market more broadly with strengthening our presence in the broker channel, as we've talked about over the course of the year. So we saw a little bit of spread compression coming through there. At the end of the year and beginning of this year, you probably noticed there was coverage by the fact that some of the better-priced products in that space had been withdrawn just as we responded to some of the pressures in that area. Other factors coming through I've already mentioned, one of it was the CML portfolio, and TLAC costs. But the discrete fourth quarter was 160 basis points, Alistair. In terms of CCAR and CML, we'll have substantially all of the assets. And by that, I mean we expect being well under $1 billion of remaining unpaid principal balances, probably around $300 million to $400 million of unpaid principal balances outstanding by the time we get to the half year. Now when you reflect on that from a CCAR and a DFAST stress-testing perspective in the U.S. it's the asset portfolio that's caused the stress. It's not per se -- it's not the existence of the legal entity. So what we would expect to have accomplished by the half year is substantially all the assets be gone and the process of winding down the legal entity has in actual fact already commenced. That is a state-by-state regulated business in the U.S. and as we come out of a state with no further loans understanding, we start rationalizing those legal entities. And clearly, for a number of years now, have been rationalizing the infrastructure supporting that business. But the cause of stress coming through CCAR and DFAST was the asset portfolio. So as that goes, the opportunity to be stressed in that regard will go with it. And in terms of encouraging, I mean, I think on Chart 20, as you see, we've laid out some of the short-term pressures that we see. Clearly, foreign exchange had an adverse impact on revenues last year. Those are [indiscernible] particularly moving in an encouraging direction in an early part of the year. We will continue with a 30 -- just over $31 billion of MREL instruments out in the market last year. Consistent with previous guidance, we've got somewhere between 60 to 80 to do, so the 2017 should be a reasonably big year in that regard once again and there will be some costs associated with that. Lower U.K. interest rate, that's just really the full year impact of what we saw happen in the bank rate area in 2016, and then there's a CML. But we do see those as largely being short-term influences. But what we have seen and we talked about it earlier is the growth coming through the Asian business and notwithstanding some of the geopolitical uncertainty in the U.K. That business performed well in Commercial Banking, Global Banking and Markets over the course of 2016 as well, and hopefully carrying some momentum into 2017. So I think in the run, we're reasonably optimistic, but we do have some short-term revenue headwinds to deal with.\\nStuart Gulliver\\nJust Alistair, the rate rise in December probably adds about $300 million to the NI of 2017 and about $500 million to $600 million in subsequent years. We've assumed 2 rate rises in this year, but in the second half of the year. So if we have a rate rise in March, that will be obviously be an earlier benefit for us. January was a strong month. GBM had a strong January, but obviously, that type of business you can't really extrapolate, but it had a strong January and so did RBWM as the impact of higher rates came through the deposit base, which is essentially the number I've just mentioned.\\nOperator\\nNext question today comes from Chira Barua from Bernstein.\\nChirantan Barua\\nThree quick ones. One, Iain, you mentioned about the CML portfolio and the wind down. We've always been interested in the excess capital there. You've announced $1 billion buyback right now from your Brazilian proceeds. How should we think about now the excess capital, when do you hear from the Fed next and when will you communicate with The Street with regards to what you do with capital repatriation from the U.S.? That's number one. Second, the reg and compliance cost just keeps going up and up. I mean, it's a significant item, and I know that you've brought in a new cost plan. It will be great to understand how do you see the $3 billion, $3.5 billion going forward over the next 3, 4 years, what is the key and what is not? And the third, a quick technical question. Your rate sensitivity on Rest of Asia has gone up sharply from the first half. Is there a liquidity book that you have moved to China and Singapore, somewhere else? Just want to understand what's driving that uptick in sensitivity.\\nIain Mackay\\nOkay, from a CML perspective or more broadly U.S. capital, we had within our CCAR submission for 2016 a dividend proposal from the U.S. holding company to the parent in early 2017. So actually, at the beginning of the second quarter in 2017. That capital plan raised no objection from the Federal Reserve, so we would expect that dividend to proceed in the early second quarter of this year. When that does proceed, we'll let you know, obviously, what the number is. Broadly speaking, we've described having in excess of $8 billion of surplus capital in the U.S., and that's been informed by the portfolio repositioning over the course of the last few years, the disposition of the credit card business back in 2012, '13, the run-off of the CML portfolio, the overall reshaping of the business. I think we've also guided that the expectation in terms of being able to move the surplus capital out of the U.S. also clearly continuing to invest appropriately in the growth of our U.S. business is something that's likely to take 3 to 5 years and certainly one of the things that informs that, in fact, the key thing that informs that, is us continuing to be successful in our CCAR submissions, our next one will be in the 1st of April of this year, and ensuring that we continue to improve our overall capacity to plan, forecast and manage the capital position within our U.S. business. But I think we certainly remain very confident in terms of being able to get the capital position in the U.S. to an appropriate standing with respect to the risks and the business that we run in the U.S., and thereby repatriating capital to the parent company. But we'll keep you posted.\\nStuart Gulliver\\nSo on regulatory programs and compliance, so as you noted, it's -- the total expenditure was about $3 billion. In 2016, it's about $400 million higher than in 2015. Of this, the spend on Global Standards was about $1.6 billion in 2016 within that $3 billion number. And probably, the expenditure on Global Standards peaks in 2017, we expect the implementation of systems and IT platform to oversee that therefore enable us to scale without incremental costs going up with that scaling. However, this is part of our BAU, so I would not expect us to see a material reduction either in that $3 billion number. But as I say, 2017 should be the peak number, but then I would expect us to see that repeat in 20 years.\\nIain Mackay\\nI think going back just momentarily to your capital question, Chira. How do we deal with that? I mean, the capital that comes back to the parent company in the form of dividends, capital transactions like the Brazilian disposal, any dividends that we've received from the U.S. legal entity or any other presumes the general capital pool of the parent company. And the deployment of that is focused on investing to grow the business, supporting the dividend for shareholders. And as we've said, from time to time, as appropriate, we'll consider buybacks. I wouldn't necessarily link any of the capital actions specifically to buybacks or anything else. It becomes part of the general pool, which Stuart and the management team, along with the board, then make decisions around how that is attributed to the various priorities.\\nStuart Gulliver\\nSo the Asia Pacific rate sensitivity, pretty big growth in deposits in China. Remember, China sits in our Asia Pacific number. Big rate move down in China on that deposit base, so much more rate sensitive. There's no book being moved.\\nOperator\\nNext question today comes from the line of Raul Sinha from JPMorgan.\\nRaul Sinha\\nIf I can have 2 please. Just the first one on the rate sensitivity again. I think you've been very clear on the short end of the curve and the sensitivity to that. But you also mentioned steepening of the U.S. and the Hong Kong yield curves. And so I was wondering if you could maybe talk a little bit about the sensitivity to the mid or the long end of the curve and how you might be positioned or changing your positioning on that, especially in Q4.\\nIain Mackay\\nAgain, not much really when you think about what were the U.S. dollar rate really benefited in the second half last year, it was at the long end, it was 10 years and beyond. When you look at the asset composition of our balance sheet, we don't have a particularly large component of the balance sheet. In fact, the relatively small proportion of the balance sheet is longer dated, with the majority really sitting below 5 years. So clearly, steepening of the curve helps us. It's going to take longer to work its way through the asset base and real results in terms of uptick. So what helps us are policy rate increases and movements in the shorter end of the curve. And so it's a help, but it does not have the same impact as things at the shorter end.\\nThe way to think about that enhancement is it's a 3-year number.\\nRaul Sinha\\nOkay, that's helpful.\\nStuart Gulliver\\nIt's kind of 1 month, 3 years is steep, we can't have a lot money riding down that curve. But think about a 3 years number. So what the 10-year or 30-year does is not that relevant.\\nIain Mackay\\nAnd I think, broadly speaking, if you think about it in these terms, we talked about this before. A rising rate environment you're generally going to see that improvement coming through in the businesses, Retail Bank, Wealth Management, Commercial Bank, Global Banks and Markets, with a possible downside to that within Balance Sheet Management. But by the same token, you will have seen highly consistent earnings coming through Balance Sheet Management over the course of the last 4 or 5 years where it is consistently falling within the $2.5 billion to $3 billion this year being at the peak end of that range.\\nRaul Sinha\\nOkay. And just the second one, we haven't talked about asset quality yet on the call. But obviously, it's very a good quarter. I think you had some write-backs in Q4 as well. But clearly, some of your peers have had different experiences more recently. And obviously, you've got quite a low risk profile in the balance sheet. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about what's the real underlying run rate you see in terms of provisions and what your thoughts are in terms of the outlook. Can it get better from this or is this as good as it gets?\\nIain Mackay\\nLook, I think one of the things -- certainly, as a couple of the Asian banks came out with their results last week, we had a quick call with our colleagues in Hong Kong over the weekend just to get any really up-to-date feedback about what we saw coming through. And the story has been remarkably consistent in terms of asset quality across Retail Bank, Commercial Banking, Global Banking and Markets. The year was clearly impacted by higher provisions on metals and mining and oil and gas sector, principally in our North American businesses. But that being said, we saw some credits coming through in Commercial Banking business in those sectors as the year progressed. But credit quality, whether you look at it from a China perspective, Hong Kong, the wider Asian, the U.K., the European, it remains very, very stable. And there are no really adverse indicators at this point coming through the book. Questions have been put to us earlier this morning by Reuters, Bloomberg, for example, is have we seen any impact from Brexit. And at this point in the game, no, we absolutely haven't. So I think overall credit quality remains stable. We did get some credits coming through in the fourth quarter, which gives us probably a slightly artificial view. But again, we're in a fairly benign point in the cycle. I am, as you know, notoriously disinclined to forecast LICs from a basis point as a percentage of outstanding loans. But again, if you sort of take kind of where you saw oil and gas, metals and mining, exposure has been dealt with by us in the course of the late 2015 and '16. And normalized for that, you get some sense as to where the run rate might be.\\nRaul Sinha\\nSure. But Iain, any thoughts on IFRS 9 and how that might change in terms of should we start to think about that from 2018 in terms of your provision?\\nIain Mackay\\nWell, the industry is certainly thinking about it big time, I think more probably in terms of the context of how it affects capital and volatility within the capital ratio. Thinking about this over the duration of our loan, it shouldn't change. If we maintain consistent underwriting and discipline in terms of how we manage the book, it should not change the lifetime loss experience. However, the timing with which that gets recognized from a Stage 1, Stage 2, Stage 3 perspective, and IFRS 9 clearly could or almost certainly will introduce some volatility. And if you were to see significant sectoral downturns, again, I'll refer back to the stuff we saw in oil and gas at the end of 2015, that would move quite a lot of the book into Stage 2, and you'd see some significant upward volatility, upward movement and one with impairment charges. But from a lifetime credit cost perspective, it shouldn't change, unless we allow that short-term volatility to further feed [ph] to how we actually underwrite and manage the exposure. And I think that's something we could focus on. If you step back from the standard itself, I think the area where our regulators are beginning, but only just beginning to think about, is how that leads through to a potential short-term volatility in capital ratios and how they deal with that. So look, the industry is full-steam ahead in implementing the standard, and it goes in the 1st of January next year. You will see volatility. In the FDI, what you'll see is credit losses are recognized much, much earlier in the cycle. Whether that necessarily is a good thing remains to be seen, but lifetime impacts should remain reasonably consistent.\\nRaul Sinha\\nOkay. And when -- just quickly, when do you think we might get some guidance in terms of the impact or the upfront impact of IFRS 9?\\nIain Mackay\\nSecond half.\\nOperator\\nNext question today comes from Claire Kane from Cr\\u00e9dit Suisse.\\nClaire Kane\\nA couple of follow-up questions on the revenue outlook, please. Firstly, on the NIM, I think you said 160 basis points for Q4. Did you say that the like-for-like sequential impact was minus 5 bps, so Q3 was 165? And also, could you explain if there was any hedging impact in there or was that 5 bps broadly related to just the U.K.? And then my second point is on the MREL or TLAC guidance. You said it would go up to $0.9 billion for 2017. Can you confirm that, that is our long-term run rate? Or should we expect that's been additional impact going into '18 and beyond if you need to be MREL-compliant by 2021? And then finally, my third question, just really to wrap it up. Clearly, from the headwinds you flagged in terms of FX broadly relates to the first half of '16. So if we consider the second half adjusted revenue run rate of around just under $49 billion, consensus is looking for around 6% uplift year-on-year versus that run rate. Given your commentary around volumes, do you think that's reasonable in the context of the NIM pressures?\\nStuart Gulliver\\nIain, go ahead.\\nIain Mackay\\nSo to be clear, the 5 bps, you're right, the 5 bps impact, it was influenced by the factors I mentioned earlier in the call with U.K. -- compression in U.K. mortgages was one of the contributors. That was about 2 or 3 basis points. TLAC and CML one-off were the other contributors. There was no real notable impact from hedging coming through in the fourth quarter. It was informed by assets on the balance sheet and movements within that. From an MREL perspective, the long-term guidance that we provided is consistent, $60 billion to $80 billion based on firming up guidance coming from our regulators as to exactly how much is required, where it is required to be positioned, the characteristics of it. Clearly, there is a first threshold, which is compliant by 2019, and that's really what we've focused on. So within that time frame, somewhere between USD 60 billion to USD 80 billion of issuance to be accomplished; $31 billion accomplished in 2016. Broadly speaking, assuming there's good reception for this in the marketplace, we'd expect it to be much the same in 2017. And to the extent that any further issuance is required, we'll complete that in 2018, then reach the first threshold of compliance in 2019. Clearly, as you point out, the final compliance time line around the full implementation of MRELs is 2022. So I think based on the guidance we are today, the $900 million is broadly consistent, subject to whether or not there is more that needs to be done in 2018. And I think we really need greater clarity in guidance around quantification and characterization and frequency of MREL from our regulators, not only in Europe, but further afield because there's -- it's not called MREL outside Europe, it's called TLAC. But it is a global phenomenon that needs to be implemented. But I wouldn't change the long-term guidance in that regard at this point. In terms of overall revenue outlook for 2017, I'm not really super keen on filling out the old spreadsheet for you there. So we've given you some pretty good guidance around what we think the FX impact is, with our other short-term pressures that we've highlighted, but we've also talked to the kind of growth that we see coming through the business. And what we've seen certainly in the fourth quarter and the first few weeks of 2017 has been encouraging in that regard.\\nClaire Kane\\nOkay. Could I maybe just have one follow-up then? In terms of the NII trajectory versus the Q4 run rate, do you think volumes would more than mitigate the NIM pressure that you've guided to relative to the Q4 base?\\nIain Mackay\\nWe will certainly be focused on the management of the assets that we underwrite. Our teams in BSM do a great job of managing the overall liquidity portfolio and interest rate risk, and they're booked for us. So our focus will be in trying to mitigate NIM pressures and continue to grow volumes to offset that, but also to grow volumes in a way that accrete returns for the business. That's a discipline which Samir and his colleagues, Noah and his colleagues, John and his colleagues are very focused on is putting business on the books that bring us to improved returns against risk-weighted assets and returns on equity in the business. And I think when you look at the return in risk-weighted assets and the improvements that Global Banking and Markets have realized, Commercial Banking have realized, that is encouraging, and that's a discipline that's going to remain in place.\\nOperator\\nNext question today comes from Tom Rayner from Exane.\\nThomas Rayner\\nJust a couple of questions, please. If we can actually just go back to the share buyback announcement because you're fairly clear that this is a first half buyback and it's very much linked still to the capital release from Brazil. So my question is once we get to, say, the interim stage that the CCAR is behind you and assuming there's no problems with any of that, is it fair to assume that then it's like a clean page for the rest of the year, we shouldn't take this $1 billion necessarily as a proxy for what you're planning to do for the year as a whole? That's my first question. And then I've got another question on the revenue headwinds, if that's okay.\\nStuart Gulliver\\nSo yes, Tom, what you should assume is that as we have evidence last year, we're starting to obviously manage our capital in a much more active way than we've been able to do previously because at 13.6%, 13.5% after this buyback, we are in a good position. And what we'll be doing is looking at what our capital position is. First of all, trying to actually not have this as surplus capital, but actually use it in the business by obviously putting on risk-weighted assets as accretive returns. If we can't put them out as accretive returns and assuming that we're nicely covered on the dividend, it's possible, subject to regulatory approval, we might look at doing further buybacks. So the first priority has got to be to see if we can actually make this work within the business, and that will be the huge focus of all of the teams. The focus of the teams is not essentially to see if we can buy back; the focus of the teams is to see if we can get accretive RWAs to close within the business. So yes, I think the way you'd characterize it is that you get to the interims with a blank sheet of paper is the way to think about it. But I don't think you should raise expectations and start modeling perpetual buybacks; we won't be doing that. If we actually do see reasonable growth coming around, if we see higher interest rates, as I've said earlier, Balance Sheet Management, the whole series of books make a lot of money and we have a north to $3 billion [ph] area, we got steeper curves, we'll actually be using that capital up in the business.\\nThomas Rayner\\nOkay. Okay, very clear. Just on the revenue headwind, just a little bit more color. You mentioned TLAC, I think, Iain, you've said the sort of $900 million for now is the guidance. I'm assuming that is -- the $900 million is a net figure, that's not a sort of cost of the new TLAC, which will be offset by some uneligible debt maturing. Is that right, what I'm thinking about?\\nIain Mackay\\nThat side is the negative carry we've talked about, Tom. Clearly, the focus within the business is to find ways of deploying that higher cost debt in a way that we can mitigate our negative carry to the extent possible. So again, that's a focus in which Balance Sheet Management is zeroed in. And clearly, we bring the expertise to bear from clearly Stuart's experience as well as Samir and the teams in terms of how we mitigate that. But that is a negative carry that we're projecting.\\nThomas Rayner\\nSure. And then just on the FX. You flagged up the $2 billion headwind if rates stay at the January level. But obviously, as it works through the P&L, it's going to affect the other lines as well. How should that drop down to sort of pretax or even net income in terms of headwind? Would it be the same sort of percentage impact all the way down the income statement?\\nIain Mackay\\nSo Tom, we would certainly expect to see some kind of corresponding benefit coming through the operating expenses, which mitigates some of that headwind that we see coming through revenues from FX. So I think if you sort of think of it in broad terms, perhaps about 30% that we see having an adverse impact on the P&L because we get some benefit coming through on impairment charges and operating expenses.\\nThomas Rayner\\nYes, okay. I'm sorry, just one very final one from me. On the -- you specifically mentioned sort of the mortgage pressure in the U.K. I'm just trying to get a sense of whether you view this as a market phenomenon or is it a real push for market share by you guys, you're happy to maybe trade off that volume margin? Or do you think it's the market itself, it's becoming more competitive?\\nIain Mackay\\nWell, I mean, certainly, this is the area where Francesca and Antonio in the U.K. could give us much more insight and detail on what's happening on a day-to-day basis. But it clearly was a competitive marketplace in 2016, true in '15, that the team in the U.K. engaged much more actively with selected brokers, to give ourselves line of sight to a larger share of the U.K. market. And from a volumes and stock perspective, we grew market share in 2016. And -- but it is clearly competitive from a pricing perspective. I think we had one of the best-priced products in the marketplace in 2016 for a significant period of time. And in the latter, I would say, the latter part of the year or very early this year, we took that particular offering off the marketplace. So it goes back to Stuart's comment. We are absolutely focused on growing our market share in products that we know we can make good returns on. But by the same token, there's a very strong focus on return generation within the business and continue to improve those returns, both in terms on return on risk-weighted assets and the wider capital equation around return on equity. So discipline around net capital deployment is the heightened and increasing level within the firm.\\nOperator\\nOur next question today comes from the line of Martin Leitgeb from Goldman Sachs.\\nMartin Leitgeb\\nI just have 3 questions, and the first one is a follow-up on earlier comments on the rate sensitivity. And I was just wondering if you could give us a steer in terms of currency denomination of your deposit base and to what percentage of your global deposits are denominated in either U.S. dollar or Hong Kong dollar. And obviously, we get the -- we got some steals debt coming from the booking location of the deposits, which would imply slightly shy of 50% on those currencies. But I was just wondering if you could give us an idea if that is the right number or if the number could be meaningfully higher in terms of U.S. dollar, Hong Kong dollar deposit exposure. The second question is to follow up on your just previous comment on Tom's question on the U.K. mortgage space. And I get a bit of sense, looking at pricing relative to market, that it seems like something held you back a little bit during the year in terms of mortgage growth in the U.K. And it seems also that the growth has accelerated in the second half. And I was just wondering if this has to do further with your rollout of intermediary networks and if we should assume that going forward from here, growth in net new mortgage lending in the U.K. would further accelerate. And the final question, also on the U.K., but here, on the current account side. It seems from what we read in the press that the current account offering at this point in time is very competitive in the U.K. And I was just wondering if you could share a bit of detail on this strategy there because looking at the latest account, it seems like that there's quite a substantial deposit overhang in the U.K. And I was just trying to get a sense on what the aim here is in terms of broadening the current account offering.\\nIain Mackay\\nSo I think if I take the last one first. You have seen again the deposit, the AD ratio, asset-deposit ratio sitting just below 68%. We saw significant customer deposit growth across each of our global businesses within 2016, most notably that was within Hong Kong, the wider Asia and the U.K. And so we've got our current accounts and overall savings proposition out there in the marketplace. Customers either like it because it has price or they like it because of the strength of the HSBC balance sheet and the overall security. I think if you were to dispose [ph] it there from a corporate perspective, it's probably the latter. And from a retail customer perspective, it's probably more difficult to point to any particular differentiation in that regard. If you think about overall deposit concentration, the greatest, the most significant deposit surplus that we carry is in Hong Kong. It is the most significant by a long stretch. It is then followed by strong deposit and AD ratios within the U.K. And then latterly, if you work down the list, you sort of come to the U.S. as sort of being third in terms of overall concentration of deposits that are either U.S. dollar directly or U.S. dollar linked. But Hong Kong is the big piece in that equation. I think in terms of mortgage growth in the U.K., there clearly was a focus in 2015 and '16 in terms of expanding our ability to access more of the market from -- in terms of being able to see more of the market in terms of accessing mortgage leads. But in terms of overall growth, it's actually been a fairly steady picture in terms of 2016 versus 2017 where we've grown at a reasonably steady pace from the first quarter of '16 through the second, third and fourth quarters. If you think about this at the beginning of the year, we had slightly less than $93 billion outstanding in U.K. mortgage balances. And at the end of the year, we had about $96 billion, and that's on a constant-currency basis. So overall, we grew the book, but I wouldn't have called it a headlong charge for growth, but there's a very strong balance between underwriting discipline and doing the right thing in terms of appropriate product for the customers in terms of the direction of the U.K. business.\\nMartin Leitgeb\\nAnd on the deposit denomination, is this roughly 50% of the -- what is reflected for the U.S. dollar, Hong Kong dollar exposure?\\nIain Mackay\\nWe'll come back to that. So like I said, the Hong Kong dollar deposits in terms of something linked to the U.S. dollar is the most significant surplus that we've got sitting around the world. I don't have the breakdown of the deposit base globally for the group by currency, but we can come back to you on that one.\\nOperator\\nNext question today comes from Jason Napier from UBS.\\nJason Napier\\nTwo on costs, please, and then one on capital. The sort of enlarged gross cost program and the breakdown of the sort of waterfall there, just wanted to ask again for a little bit more color on the inflation of your rate costs, that's well over $1 billion now versus the original plan. Is there some sense as to what has changed there? I appreciate the comments on taking it as OpEx. I'm just interested in the sort of -- in the way that things have turned out. And likewise, the very substantial increase in transformational savings that you're aiming for strips by division, where that is coming from given the size of the numbers. Secondly, a much easier one, the Corporate Centre costs x levy look reassuringly stable at about $250 million [ph] a quarter. I just wondered if that sort of an underlying $1 billion a year run rate for Corp Centre x levy was about right. And then I have a last question on capital.\\nIain Mackay\\nCan you give me the question on capital?\\nJason Napier\\nCertainly. So -- and I'm afraid I'm really just asking you to rehearse what I think you already said at Q3 around the change in treatment of BoCom. But if I think about some of the comments today, the buyback announced today takes you to 13.5% for CET1. The $8 billion of capital that you've mentioned, you said, is potentially excess in the U.S., it's another 100 basis points, and BoCom is worth a little over 100 in Q3. I'm just trying to understand again whether the sense from yourself is that the change in treatment at the PRA level is in the near term or in the medium term distributable, because that would imply a sort of a new running deck for capital requirement of 11.5%, which I think many investors might regard as too good to be true.\\nIain Mackay\\nSorry, can you grant your rationale for 11.5%? You're suggesting that an appropriate ratio for the group is 11.5% common equity tier 1?\\nJason Napier\\nWell, I'm just trying to check the math. So I think in a response to an earlier question, you said that you suggested that excess capital in the U.S. was $8 billion, so that's 100 basis points. The benefit in Q3 from the PRA has changed to the BoCom treatment was 104 basis points. So kind of where you are now net of those 2 things is 11.5%. And I was just -- wanted to get your sense as to -- yes?\\nIain Mackay\\nOne way to think about it, we've set out a common equity tier 1 ratio target of 12% to 13%. And I think for probably the last 12 to 18 months, we've been pretty clear that probably at the top end of that range is the appropriate place for us to be. Certainly, until some of the regulatory uncertainty that still persists is resolved in an appropriate manner, clearly, it's a little bit disappointing that we didn't get the final guidance on Basel III revisions or Basel IV in January. We'll hopefully get something on that later this year. But no, our common equity tier 1, sitting at 13.5% after this buyback, is 50 basis points above the top end of the range that we would target. So therefore, it kind of comes back to Stuart's comments, when we have capital resources at the group that are in excess of our common equity tier 1 ratio, there's a number of factors we'll consider. One, the investment opportunity at improved return levels within the group, the overall coverage for the dividend and then consider the opportunity for buyback. The other factors that clearly flow into that is where we are with respect to overall stability in the regulatory environment as it relates to capital resources and, more broadly, dealing with uncertainty from a geopolitical perspective and how that could impact the overall revenue and profit generation within the group. So there are -- it is a multifaceted problem that the industry faces, and I think we've got a pretty sensible and sound framework around dealing with that. But do not assume that moving significantly below 13% is something that we would countenance in the short, medium or long term.\\nJason Napier\\nThat's very clear.\\nIain Mackay\\nOkay. From a cost perspective, going to the overall compliance. So the overall regulatory and compliance costs were well beyond the Global Standards. The Global Standards is a significant component of that. And as Stuart pointed out, we continue to invest on delivering our commitments against the U.S. deferred prosecution agreement, the agreement with the Financial Conduct Authority in the U.K. And that is a level of investment that we would expect. And certainly, Colin Bell, who leads that overall focus for us, is firmly of the view that investment in that area will peak in 2017, and that's consistent with previous guidance that we provided in that regard. Other programs that flow into that, stress-testing, we do multiple stress tests around the world for regulators. We had over 60 stress tests last year informed by regulatory guidance. We have our own internal stress testing program that's been running for many years that really informs questions that Marc Moses, our Chief Risk Officer, Stuart, the board have that we stress test against. It also covers implementation of bidding transparency in the United Kingdom. It covers implementation of IFRS 9. It covers CCAR in the United States. So it's a broad base of programs that are dealt with in the regulatory and compliance space. Implementation of a senior manager resumed in the U.K. is another that falls into this area. The area of expanded investment is primarily within the Global Standards program as it relates to anti-money laundering and sanctions control and overall financial crime risk management, and we would expect that investment to peak in 2017. And as Stuart said, we would expect that to become part of the run rate. I think our view is that we will deliver our productivity over time, but we will deliver that productivity over the broader suite of regulatory compliance -- regulatory and compliance programs as opposed to specifically within the Global Standards program. In terms of what's really delivering the cost saves, it's across each of the global businesses focused both on front-office and back-office processes. There is some very significant contribution to the strong -- our technology and operations teams in terms of the efficiency with which our service centers around the world operate, loading and optimization of the workforce within those in terms of getting better efficiency in terms of responding to customer requirements, collection activities, for example. From a technology perspective, the overhaul that Andy Maguire and Darryl West have led across the organization is leading to some significant savings. One of the consequences that you saw from that was the impairment that we took in the fourth quarter against some of the software that we no longer deploy within the business. But it is really across every aspect of the business within the supporting functions, across risk, across finance, we've seen significant savings realized as we improved processes. And really, what we've seen, which has informed the increase of the targets, is not necessarily a proliferation of programs that we've got delivering those efficiencies, but getting greater yield from the programs that we've already launched. Clearly, there are more programs to be launched, but the main contributor is greater yields from programs that we've already had up and running and, frankly, getting better at this as time goes on. I think the other point to make here is this is not about getting at the end of '17, dropping the tools, taking a big rest, slurping back a glass of champagne and congratulating ourselves; but it's about counting that productivity into 2018 and beyond.\\nJason Napier\\nAnd then the last one was Corporate Centre x levy, about $1 billion a year, that feels like a sort of stable-ish number, does it? Or [indiscernible] to the new divisions?\\nIain Mackay\\nIt's not a bad number for '17. But just as the rest of the business is focused on delivering cost savings and better processes, our Corporate Centre is focused on the same thing. So it's not a bad number, but we'll be working on -- we'll be focused on trying to work down a little bit in this cycle as well.\\nDouglas Flint\\nWe've got time for one last question.\\nOperator\\nWe will take our last question today from Stephen Andrews from Deutsche Bank.\\nStephen Andrews\\nJust comes back to that last question on Slide 7 on the Corporate Centre and that $1 billion for the year x levy. Can you just make a comment on the bank levy? I mean, it came in a little bit lower than expectation. You said there was a write-back. What you would expect that to be this year, because I think it was about $300 million better than people's expectations.\\nIain Mackay\\nYes. So the rate dropped. So you'll recall from the budget in 2015, I think, the rate will drop each year from now to 2021 when the basis of assessment will go from the consolidated balance sheet of the group to the U.K. balance sheet of the group. And it is in 2021 when we will realize a significant reduction in the bank levy, assuming that, that budget undertaking in legislation remains in place. What you should expect between now and 2020 is somewhere in the range of $1 billion to $1.1 billion each year for the bank levy.\\nStephen Andrews\\nSo net of the bank levy, we should just really be running that Corporate Centre forward to 0 because it looks like a lot of TLAC costs, the roll-off costs now of the U.S. CML, all of this in that Corporate Centre with the new breakdown, is that correct? So do you think about any contribution at all from the Corporate Centre, which has been positive in the past?\\nIain Mackay\\nI'm sorry, when you say positive, what do you mean?\\nStephen Andrews\\nWell, if you -- if I go to Slide 7 and look at the sort of underlying run rates you're giving on the businesses, you've got the global businesses and the Corporate Centre. And the Corporate Centre, as you rightly pointed out in your comments, is the minus $621 million in the last quarter which was the debt issue.\\nIain Mackay\\nYes.\\nStephen Andrews\\nIf I'm right, what you were saying just now with the previous question was that we're looking about $1 billion, that running at $1 billion for the full year x the levy? Because there was just a lot more drag on that going forward, as you've pointed out. So if you're saying $1 billion for the full year, we take off the $1.1 billion, essentially for the full year, we should be pretty much forecasting that as 0 for the full year at each quarter. I know you don't give forecast, but how we should think about it?\\nIain Mackay\\nSo from an x levy perspective?\\nStephen Andrews\\nYes, no, including levy full year, roughly 0.\\nIain Mackay\\nWell, but remember what's going through the Corporate Centre here. You've got the associates, you've got BoCom, you've got Saudi British Bank, you've got headquarter operating expenses, you've got the net of our corporate -- our global service centers, revenue and expenses coming through that, you've got a proportion of the TLAC cost coming through that, some of which clearly has pushed down to the operating entities as we preposition that. So there are still -- clearly, there's very active tools coming through the Corporate Centre. I mean, x levy, I think the better analysis is the x levy is, from an operating expense perspective, subject to comments I made, is probably $1 billion.\\nStephen Andrews\\nX levy, okay. So including levy, okay.\\nIain Mackay\\nOkay?\\nStephen Andrews\\nYes.\\nDouglas Flint\\nOkay. Thanks, everyone.\\nStuart Gulliver\\nThank you very much.\\nIain Mackay\\nThank you.\\nOperator\\nThank you, ladies and gentlemen, that concludes the call for the HSBC Holdings plc's Annual Results 2016.

For your information, this conference is being recorded.\\nAt this time, I will hand the call over to your host, Mr. Stuart Gulliver, Group Chief Executive.\\nStuart Gulliver\\nThanks very much. So good afternoon from Hong Kong; good morning to everyone in London, and welcome to our first quarter results call. With me today is Iain, who's going to talk through the detailed financial performance. We'll both then take questions, but I'll start by pulling out a few highlights.\\nOur first quarter performance was resilient in market conditions that challenged the entire banking industry. Against the very strong first quarter of 2015, profits were down, although we increased market share in many of the product areas that are critical to our strategy. Market uncertainty led to extreme levels of volatility in January and February, which affected our ability to generate revenue in our Markets and Wealth Management businesses. Both businesses recovered well in March.\\nOur diversified universal banking business model helped to cushion the impact through growth in other parts of the bank. Commercial Banking continued its momentum in spite of the slowdown in global trade, and we increased market share across our strategic trade corridors. We also grew revenue elsewhere in Retail Banking and Wealth Management, particularly current accounts and savings in Hong Kong and the U.K., and personal lending in Asia and Mexico.\\nA combination of tight cost management and the increasing impact of our cost savings programs reduced operating expenses compared to the fourth quarter and kept them broadly unchanged compared to the first quarter of 2015. Loan impairment charges were down by $450 million compared to the fourth quarter and up by $692 million compared to the first quarter of 2015.\\nWe maintained a strong common equity Tier 1 ratio of 11.9%, adding $800 million to capital, net of dividends. We also maintained a strong leverage ratio of 5%. In March, we sold $10.5 billion equivalent of TLAC securities in U.S. dollars and euros across 5 separate tranches in a range of maturities in both fixed and floating format. Our order books were well oversubscribed, in spite of market volatility and difficult new issue conditions, with demand from an extremely broad range of investors. This was the largest senior unsecured fundraising by banks since 2008, and it reopened the benchmark wholesale funding markets for U.K. and European bank holding companies. Our targeted initiatives removed another $15 billion of risk-weighted assets in the first quarter. The risk-weighted assets increased overall due to an increase in corporate lending. There were also higher market volatility, and some corporate credit downgrades also increased risk-weighted assets. We remain on track to hit our risk-weighted asset reduction target.\\nThe technical body of the Brazilian competition agency has now recommended to its board that the sale of our Brazil business be approved. We await a final decision from the competition agency. This is the final regulatory approval required prior to the completion of the transaction. Completing the transaction will add approximately 60 basis points to our common equity Tier 1 ratio.\\nOur Asian businesses continued to gain momentum. We made important market share gains in debt capital markets, China M&A and syndicated lending. We also had strong business wins on the back of our increased investment in Asia, and we extended our leadership in services related to renminbi internationalization.\\nIain is going to now take you through the numbers.\\nIain Mackay\\nThanks, Stuart. Looking quickly at some key metrics for first quarter. The reported return on average ordinary shareholders' equity was 9%. The reported return on average tangible equity was 10.3%; and on an adjusted basis, we had a negative jaws of 2.8%. The movement in jaws was mainly due to a 3.8% decline in adjusted revenue, which exceeded a 1% fall in adjusted costs.\\nThis next slide takes us from reported to adjusted. Reported profit before tax of $6.1 billion for the first quarter included a $1.2 billion gain for fair value on our own debt relating to credit spread and $479 million of other significant items. Allowing for these items leaves an adjusted profit before tax of $5.4 billion for the first quarter. You'll find more details on these adjustments in the appendix. And we'll focus on adjusted numbers for the remainder of this presentation.\\nThis next slide shows a comparison with the fourth quarter of 2015. Adjusted profit before tax was $3.6 billion higher than the fourth quarter due to higher revenue, lower loan impairment charges and costs. You'll recall that the bank levy influences the fourth quarter numbers. Excluding the bank levy, operating expenses fell by $236 million. Loan impairment charges were $450 million lower, mainly in Commercial Banking. The fourth quarter included an increase in specific loan impairment charges in a small number of countries, which largely affected local factors and collective charges relating to oil and gas.\\nSlide 6 breaks down adjusted profit by global business and geography on a period-by-period basis. These profits were achieved in challenging market conditions and relative to a very strong first quarter last year. The main business drivers of the reduction in profit were lower revenue in Global Banking and Markets and Retail Banking and Wealth Management. An increased loan impairment charges in the Global Banking and Markets principally related to oil and gas and metals and mining.\\nWe've split out Brazil from the rest of the group here to show the impact that it had on our numbers in the first quarter. This also gives you a basis for comparison from when Brazil drops out of our numbers following completion of the transaction. We expect this would have positive impact on operating expenses, loan impairment charges and capital.\\nSlide 7 shows an analysis of revenue. As Stuart said earlier, conditions in the first 2 months of the year were difficult, particularly in our Markets business and Wealth Management. There was a clear improvement in March, however, and that continued into April. You'll recall that our performance in the first quarter of 2015 included the positive impact of the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect; and the strong renminbi market, which benefited us more than most. It's worth noting that our revenues are down no more than the industry average in spite of this.\\nIn Principal Retail Banking and Wealth Management, revenue was $270 million or 5% lower than the first quarter of 2015. This was mainly in Wealth Management, caused by the impact of adverse movements in interest rates in equity markets and life insurance as well as lower customer activity. We did, however, grow revenue from customer accounts in Hong Kong and the U.K. and from higher personal lending in Latin America and Asia.\\nCommercial Banking revenue continued to grow, driven by higher average balances in Payments and Cash Management and further loan growth. Client-facing global banks and markets revenue was down by $286 million or 7% compared to a strong performance in the prior year. In common with the rest of the banking industry, extreme levels of market volatility led to reduced client activity in our markets business, particularly in equities and credit and foreign exchange. Revenue was up in rates. There was a $172 million reduction in revenue from Balance Sheet Management due in large part to lower gains on disposal of available-for-sale securities. Global Private Banking revenue is down by $87 million or 15% due to lower brokerage and trading activity in Europe and Asia. However, we attracted $4 billion of net new money in the quarter.\\nOther provided $179 million of revenue in the first quarter. This included favorable fair value movements associated with long-term debt issued by HSBC Holdings. These are related to interest and exchange rate risk but not our own credit spread, which we excluded from adjusted performance. In last year's first quarter, Other had losses of $200 million, mainly from the adverse impact of certain intra-group adjustments. This means that revenue for Other was up by $379 million on a quarter-by-quarter basis.\\nLoan impairment charges were $692 million higher than the first quarter of 2015 but $450 million lower than the fourth quarter. $159 million of the increase on the first quarter of 2015 came specifically from Brazil due to difficult economic and trading conditions. These were mostly collectively assessed impairments in Retail Banking and Wealth Management.\\nThe increase also includes an adjustment of around $100 million in our U.S. runoff portfolio. Charges in wholesale were up by $380 million. Q1 included additional specific charges related to oil and gas, mainly in the U.S. and Canada. There was also a charge in Australia relating to metals and mining as well as higher specific charges in a small number of countries. As the chart shows, the level of loans reported as past due but not impaired continues to reflect our risk management. And as we said at our annual results, we continue to monitor oil and gas sector closely and to manage our exposures accordingly. There's a detailed overview of our oil and gas and metals and mining exposure in the appendix.\\nAdjusted operating expenses were $76 million or 1% lower than the first quarter of 2015. Excluding bank levy adjustments in each period, we were successful in keeping costs broadly unchanged in spite of the effects of inflation and $743 million of investment in regulatory programs and compliance.\\nThis investment reflected the continued implementation of our Global Standards program and other requirements. And as we said in June, we expect this investment to continue throughout 2016 and to flatten in 2017 as increased automation and process improvements take effect.\\nYou'll recall that our cost savings program is designed to cover the cost of investments in Global Standards, investment in growth and the impact of inflation as well as to achieve an exit rate equivalent to 2014 by the end of 2017.\\nIn Commercial Banking, our cost reduction initiatives neutralized the effect of both inflation and increased investment in Global Standards. These included our simplified organization structure and process optimization within our lending, onboarding and servicing platforms.\\nCosts were down marginally in Retail Bank Wealth Management as investments in our Asia branch network and inflationary pressures were more than offset by cost savings, including our digital transformation and branch optimization programs. Costs fell in Global Banking and Markets due primarily to lower staff performance costs in Asia, Europe and the United States.\\nThis continues the good start that we made to our cost saving program, and we remain confident of hitting our cost target. Rebased for currency translation and the sale of Brazil, that target is now $29.1 billion.\\nTurning to capital. The group's common equity Tier 1 ratio was maintained at 11.9%. We increased common equity Tier 1 capital by $2 billion in the first quarter. This was from capital generation through profits, net of dividends, of around $800 million. And we benefited from favorable foreign currency translation differences of $1 billion. While total risk-weighted assets increased in the first quarter, we continued to make progress with our risk-weighted assets initiatives. The next slide sets out the movements in more detail.\\nThe increase in risk-weighted assets in the first quarter was a result of book size and quality. Growth in book size was mainly driven by 2 things: increased corporate lending, mainly in Commercial Banking and Global Banking and Markets; and increased market volatility and client activity, impacting counterparty credit risk and market risk. Each of these accounted for around half of the movement in book size. Book quality represents risk-weighted asset movements due to changes in the underlying credit quality of our customers.\\nThese movements were partially offset by the -- by our continued progress in RWA initiatives. Our investor -- at our investor update in 2015, we set a target to reduce group's risk-weighted assets by $290 billion by the end of 2017. The chart on the top right of the page shows this target adjusted for the latest foreign exchange rates. This gives a rebased target of $279 billion. Since the start of 2015, we've reduced risk-weighted assets by $139 billion, of which $15 billion was in the first quarter of this year. These reductions include legacy credit and U.S. runoff portfolios. Our risk-weighted asset reduction plans are on track, and we remain confident of hitting our targets by the end of 2017.\\nThe reported return on risk-weighted assets was 2.2% compared to 2.4% in the first quarter of 2015. We continue to work towards an adjusted return on risk-weighted assets of greater than 2.3% by 2017.\\nI'll now hand back to Stuart.\\nStuart Gulliver\\nThank you. This slide provides a summary of our progress in the 11 months since our investor update. Iain has already talked about risk-weighted assets and I've already talked about Brazil, so I'm going to concentrate on the other actions here.\\nOur U.S. and Mexico businesses are heading in the right direction. Adjusted profits in our principal U.S. business grew by 29% to $181 million largely due to lower operating expenses. Revenue was up by another 4%. And we've continued to make solid progress in running down our U.S. CML legacy portfolio, including the disposal of a $1.4 billion tranche in April.\\nIn Mexico, adjusted profit before tax of $72 million was up 104% on the first quarter of 2015. This was due to higher lending balances in Retail Banking and Wealth Management, higher insurance revenues and improved collaboration between Retail Banking and Wealth Management and Commercial Banking. We're also gaining good traction in terms of cross-border business in the area recovered by NAFTA. We have double-digit growth in Commercial Banking across the free trade zone, and we're currently winning around 3 out of 4 cross-border deals in the region.\\nAs Iain has already said, we've made good progress in operating expenses while continuing to invest in growth initiatives and regulatory programs and compliance.\\nAll of our cost programs are now underway. We have reduced employee numbers by around 6,000 since the first quarter of last year. And the sale of Brazil will reduce FTEs by a further 19,000 to bring the group total to 235,000. This compares with 295,000 on the 31st December 2010. As this trend illustrates, we've got a good grip on costs. Although progress will not be linear, we're confident of hitting our target by the end of 2017.\\nOur Payments and Cash Management business maintained its strong momentum with an increase of 7% on the first quarter of last year. And Global Trade and Receivables Finance maintained its position in a slow trade environment and captured additional market share across our top 23 strategic corridors. In the first quarter, we also received clearance to offer our own credit cards in mainland China.\\nAdjusted profit before tax was $357 million in ASEAN, which was up 14% due to lower LICs and lower costs. We have also increased assets under management in Asia by 10% in the first quarter and grew revenue from insurance manufacturing new business premiums in Asia by 18% to around USD 600 million. Revenue from renminbi internationalization was down, but we have strengthened our leadership position in the quarter. I'll talk more about this on the next slide.\\nSlide 14 shows the numbers behind the story. We've increased our market shares across a number of product lines, as we've invested in the business and as competitors have withdrawn from some of our core markets. In the first quarter, we held our share of the market in Global Trade and Receivables Finance but increased our market share in 4 out of 5 regions in documentary trade. We also strengthened our leadership position in Payments and Cash Management. We are a market leader in Asia advisory business and have strengthened that position considerably. We're the established #1 underwriter in debt capital markets, and we've retained our #1 ranking for syndicated loans in Hong Kong and Mainland China and further increased our market share there. We've also dramatically increased our share of the Asian M&A market.\\nFinally, we've retained our #1 position in the league tables for offshore renminbi bonds and have a 52% share of the Securities Services RQFII market. This puts us in an excellent position not just to benefit from a more stable renminbi market, but from the relaxation of investment barriers for onshore bonds and the likely rollout of the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect later this year. No other bank is in this strong position to capitalize on these opportunities.\\nIn summary, we've shown resilience and made further progress towards the completion of our strategic actions. We intend to keep reporting on this progress on a quarterly basis.\\nThe market volatility that affected the first 2 months of the year has largely stabilized. March was a better month than both January and February, and April has continued in broadly the same vein. Despite the difficult conditions, our diversified and balanced business has enabled us to continue to generate growth and to capture market share where possible.\\nThere continues to be plenty of revenue opportunities available to us in the coming quarters, particularly in the areas that we are targeting for growth. The planned Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect and the opening up of the China interbank bond market will enable us to capitalize on our market access in Asia. The increase in Chinese ODI and M&A involving Chinese firms plays to our leadership of the Asian advisory market. And the rollout of the Belt and Road initiative and the growth of green finance will create opportunities in infrastructure finance and green bonds, both of which are already significant areas of strength for HSBC.\\nWe are confident of achieving our target of $4.5 billion to $5 billion of cost savings by the end of 2017. And our strong balance sheet gives us the latitude to manage the business for the long term in accordance with our strategy.\\nWe'll now take questions. The operator will explain the procedure and then introduce the first question. Operator?\\nOperator\\n[Operator Instructions] We will now take our first question today from Alastair Ryan from Bank of America.\\nAlastair Ryan\\nTwo from me, please. First, the net interest margin sounds like it's stabilizing underlying in the quarter but down a bit on a reported basis. Ex Brazil, now that the feds started hiking rates, if only a little, can you give us any sense of whether you've hit the bottom on the margin? There's been a sort of a long downdraft. Has rate hit 0? And second, on trade, you sound a bit more downbeat in the text but a bit more positive on this call. Can you give us a sense where you think your trade revenues are headed across volumes and margins, please?\\nIain Mackay\\nYes, on net interest margin, Alastair, very, very stable compared to the fourth quarter of last year. And I think that can be true really across all of the main product lines with respect to NIMs. I think going forward one of the things that will create a little bit of pressure on NIM at a group level is the cost of TLAC. And we talked about that at the end of the year and going forward, but when you look at it on a trading basis, the net interest margin has been very stable in the fourth quarter. And certainly, there were no indications of particular pressure coming through beyond some of the factors that we talked about a few weeks ago when we released the full year numbers, so very consistent.\\nStuart Gulliver\\nSo going on trade. So the overall macro backdrop, as you know, is that trade growth was very sluggish, with about 2.8% growth for last year, in 2015, and actually quite a sharp decline in the value of trade by about 13%. Those are overall WTO numbers. What we've seen within our business is that growth in trade within Global Banking and Markets, where revenue is up about 3%; and a decline in CMB, where revenue was down about 6%. But if you dig into it, there's a decline in documentary trade balances, which are down about 13%, but actually structured trade finance, receivables finance is up about 15%. Now actually, that's longer-term positive for margins because documentary credits have been extremely competitive with very, very tight margins. So as the market moves towards structured trade and receivables finance, that actually should offer some revenue growth. As it stands, we've grown market share. The HKMA data here suggests that the overall market for trade balances, this is February '16 Hong Kong Monetary Authority number, was down about 34% in Hong Kong. And we're down about 9% in Hong Kong, which indicates that we've taken market share. So to be honest, we are slightly more positive than perhaps the text suggests, but it's a complicated picture. But what we can see is that we're outperforming the overall market across all 23 of our strategic trade corridors, and our declines are considerably less than the market is showing. And there's a switch from documentary credits towards structured trade, which itself has better margins.\\nOperator\\nOur next question today comes from Raul Sinha from JPMorgan.\\nRaul Sinha\\nStuart, Iain, can I have a couple of questions, please, for the revenues? The first one is on Page 20 of your release, where you talk about Principal RBWM. And I particularly wanted to focus on wealth products, where you obviously had $1.2 billion of top line this quarter. And that was one of the areas which was impacted by the volatility. But if you look at your -- the comps against last year, for example, last year, you had $1.9 billion of revenues in this business in the second quarter, presumably helped by the China bull market. So I was just wondering if you can talk a little bit about the outlook for this business, what -- how would you characterize your performance in the first quarter here? And how should we expect this to move going forward?\\nIain Mackay\\nYes, Raul, I think one of the things to bear in mind about the first quarter of last year was an incredibly strong performance coming through in the back of the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect, which represent a significant uplift to revenues coming through retail bank Wealth Management in the Asian market, specifically Wealth Management. The other feature that, again, added a somewhat positive effect overall on PVIF coming through in the first quarter of last year, we saw almost the exact opposite in the first quarter of 2016. And when you look at the overall impact on retail bank Wealth Management revenues, that's really what it boils down to; is a -- market updates coming through PVIF in the insurance manufacturing businesses, and that is mostly within Hong Kong and France; and then the impact of lower brokerage revenues. When you look at the performance coming through, if you like, the installed base of current accounts, deposit accounts, mortgages, unsecured personal lending, overall the outlook remains fairly stable across each of the major markets for us. The U.K. has been reasonably positive for us in the first quarter. Hong Kong, for fairly obvious reasons, has been a little bit slower, but the main drivers of the lower revenues have been the 2 features and the comparison to first quarter of last year.\\nStuart Gulliver\\nIt's worth bearing in mind that it's a combination of Retail Banking and Wealth Management, as the name suggests. So the Wealth Management piece, as Iain's just outlined, is kind of weak because we had such a strong first and second quarter of last year, but actually, we've got good growth in current accounts and savings and in personal lending. So if you look at the Retail Banking piece, current account, savings and deposits, if you're on Page 20, you can see growth. And you can also see growth in the personal lending piece. So actually, it's not an -- it's not just the Wealth Management business. It's both the Retail Banking, i.e. deposits and loans; as well as the Wealth Management piece. Your second question, Raul?\\nRaul Sinha\\nOkay. And then just on that sort of leading into the jaws and your outlook for positive jaws for this year. Obviously, costs down 2% ex the investment in reg spend and the levy credit, and revs down 4% underlying. I guess you probably want to narrow and turn that round as the year progresses, but I suspect you'd probably need a little bit of help from the revenue environment. Or is there something that I'm missing in terms of costs that we should expect the cost momentum to build as we move through the year?\\nIain Mackay\\nI think a little bit of help on the revenue line would certainly be appreciated. The focus on the costs is to hit the $4.5 billion to $5 billion of cost take-outs by the end of 2017 such that we get that 2014 run rate. There's good traction around that. We've got all the programs up and running, so the focus is very much in making sure that we can stay on top of and execute against the things we control. That being said, within the revenue space, a little bit of help would be appreciated, but again, I think if you look at the underlying development of Commercial Banking, in the first quarter, it was reasonably encouraging when you consider the underlying trading conditions. Overall, looking at Global Banking and Markets, excluding Balance Sheet Management, down 7%, which I think is a bit of a standout on an industry comparison perspective. And we clearly saw some of the stabilization coming through in our March revenues, and that has been broadly sustained through April. And then retail bank Wealth Management, again there's a very strong focus from John and the team in terms of, one, executing against the -- their share of the $4.5 billion to $5 billion in terms of managing the overall cost equation; and also, obviously, a focus on continuing to build the customer relationships that support revenue. So we're not necessarily depending on a significant upgrade in rates, but clearly, a slightly more stable, less-volatile environment coming out of the first quarter into second will, hopefully, be helpful.\\nOperator\\nOur next question today comes from the line of Chira Barua from Bernstein.\\nChirantan Barua\\nJust a quick one on Hong Kong. I've been following this for a long time. This is the first quarter after ages that I've seen Hong Kong loan growth down across retail, commercial, global markets, Private Banking sequentially, so it will be great to get some color on what's happening. Stuart, your comments on trade, very helpful; the same on the retail side or the commercial side in terms of growth. What are the dependencies into, not only this quarter, this year going forward would be much appreciated.\\nIain Mackay\\nI think there's probably not a great deal that we can add, Chira, on top of what we've answered the last couple of questions here. I think what we saw, certainly within the retail bank Wealth Management space in Hong Kong, was a growth in current accounts. And one suspects that that's a feature of many of our customers sitting in the sideline, waiting to see slightly more stable environment for investing, which certainly should help support the Wealth Management revenue equation going forward in slightly more stable markets. So that's certainly an expectation that we'd like to see. Overall, Commercial Banking continues to perform reasonably well. And Global Banking and Markets in Asia was afflicted with the same sort of underlying trends that we saw coming through our European and U.S. business. And improvements that we've seen coming through March and April in that regard, again, are somewhat encouraging. And it can -- it goes without saying that Peter and the team in Asia are -- continue to be very closely focused on the overall cost management picture. Also, we do have a very robust 39% cost efficiency ratio within the Hong Kong market. I think the overall -- the other thing that's worth mentioning is that within our ASEAN markets, we saw an improvement in PBT over the course of the first quarter, with lower loan impairment charges and good cost control across the businesses and reasonably constructive revenue environment. So notwithstanding the fact that Hong Kong is hugely important, there is more than just one arrow in the quiver on this front.\\nOperator\\nOur next question today comes from David Lock from Deutsche Bank.\\nDavid Lock\\nThree quick ones from me, please. First of all, on rates. It looks like you had a very strong performance in the quarter; about 20% up. I just wondered, within the context of your commentary about the first 2 months of the year being a bit weaker and the third month being a bit better and that continuing, if you'd give a little bit of color about that rates performance. Should we expect that to be sustained into the second quarter? Second question is on costs to achieve. I think, so far, you've taken about $1.3 billion since the beginning of 2015, so probably a little bit behind the $4 billion to $4.5 billion run rate. So I just wondered if you could update us on the phasing of that and when we might expect that to flow through. And then thirdly, on GBM Balance Sheet Management. I think, in the past, you've given us a little guidance on how we should expect that to evolve over the course of the year. I just wondered if you had any views at the first quarter on what we might expect for BSM this year.\\nStuart Gulliver\\nSo Balance Sheet Management, about $2.5 billion. Rates, no, I don't think you can extrapolate that forward. What I think you can more look at is the recovery in foreign exchange, credit and equities. Remember total client-facing Global Banking and Markets revenues were only down 7%, which actually, as Iain was saying earlier, compared to most of the industry, was a very strong performance. Our GBM business, as we've been saying kind of repeatedly for a very long term, has a kind of different mixture. If you add in Balance Sheet Management, the overall adjusted revenues for the business are down 12%. I don't think that you should be assuming a continued outperformance from rates but more that in March and April, more normalized trading conditions return, so helping the foreign exchange and equity piece more.\\nIain Mackay\\nOn CTA, David, I wouldn't necessarily expect absolute linearity into -- coming through the cost to achieve; just as we've talked about, not -- hopefully, not anticipating exact linearity coming through in the actual costs being realized. What I would say is that normally, on the basis that we're going to recognize our $4.5 billion to $5 billion of saves by the end of 2017, you can expect the cost to achieve to come through slightly ahead in terms of the actual cost savings. So we're about 1 -- just over $1.2 billion since inception through to the current point. And there is -- I think Stuart mentioned it in his comments, all of the programs and projects that we've got focused on realizing cost saves are up now and -- are up and running now, and as a consequence of which, we'll continue to see the cost to achieve coming through over the course of the coming quarters.\\nOperator\\nOur next question today comes from Tom Rayner from Exane.\\nThomas Rayner\\nCan I have 2 questions, please? First, to just go back to Hong Kong, see if I can get any more out of you. I mean it accounted for about 38% of group profit in the first quarter. The loan book looks like it's contracted, annualized, 13% in Q1, commercial itself down 20% on an annualized run rate, so either something has happened in the first quarter to explain that or it looks like a fairly big sort of retrenching in terms of your sort of appetite to lend. I noticed the loan-to-deposit ratio has fallen from 56% a year ago to about 48% now. So I just wondered if I could push you a bit more for some comments on what's happening in Hong Kong specifically. And I have a second question, on Slide 11, which is the RWA slide. I don't know if you want that now or to take it separately.\\nIain Mackay\\nHang on, Tom. On Tom, we -- on Hong Kong, we had a number of large corporate repayments in the first quarter of the year. I think the other thing that would have characterized the first quarter was relatively low demand for credits. And I think, again, that kind of goes to some of the things we've already talked about with respect to retail bank Wealth Management as well as Global Banking and Markets. But the main feature that we saw in terms of really impacting balance sheet was a little bit of corporate repayment coming through the first quarter and lower demand. It certainly wasn't specifically as a consequence of a reduction in risk appetite from the Asian businesses perspective. We also saw slightly lower mortgages. As you've seen coming through a lot of the media coverage, there's an expectation of declining property prices within the Hong Kong environment. And again, just a little bit of risk aversion with respect to part of our customers waiting to see if the environment settles down is probably the best way to characterize that at the moment, Tom.\\nStuart Gulliver\\nAnd another thing, Tom, that you'd have had in the first quarter of 2015, which is related to -- and in the second quarter of 2015, which is related to Hong Kong-Shanghai Stock Connect, is actually quite a lot of margin lending against equities, which clearly wasn't repeated in the first quarter of this year, which also would explain a chunk of the reduction in loans and advances.\\nThomas Rayner\\nSure. Okay, so when you sort of strip through all of that, I mean, are you looking at a reasonably stable loan book, do you think; or a small contraction or small growth? What's your sort of gut feel for the true underlying sort of business that is...\\nStuart Gulliver\\nI think, flat, to be honest, Tom, flat. Flat.\\nThomas Rayner\\nFlattish, yes, okay. Okay. Slide 11, I just wonder if you could add a bit more color to some of the big moving parts in reconciling the RWA movements. I know there's some explanation in the text. The increase due to book size, given again little real growth in the loan book, looks quite large. And then there's possibly the corporate downgrades driving the quality. Is there anything else you can add to what's going on to give us a feel for what we should be thinking about for the rest of the year on some of those drivers, please?\\nIain Mackay\\nIn terms of book size, Tom, there was about 50% of that came from actually growing lending. And that's made up across the north -- well, the U.S., in the U.K. and in Mexico were the main drivers in terms of growth coming through from a book size perspective. And then what you also have is obviously some step-up in market risk -- risk-weighted assets coming through, some of the volatility that we saw in the first quarter reflected at VaR and stressed VaR and then counterparty credit risk. That's really what we saw going on. So of that $16 billion book size, about 50-50 was split between actual growth in credits and lending to customers and then market volatility effects coming through, principally market risk and counterparty credit risk. And then book quality was really a reflection of the downgrades that we saw happening across both the oil and gas sector and the metals and mining sector principally, which again, when you look at the external factors, you would generally have expected to that -- to see that coming through.\\nThomas Rayner\\nSo if I -- is it fair to say then, if I'm thinking about going forward, the $9 billion of book quality won't necessarily repeat; and half of that increase in book size is volatility which might reverse, might get worse but it's not something which you should expect quarter in, quarter out?\\nIain Mackay\\nNo. I think it is that the aspect of market volatility is going to be driven by exactly that, but there's not necessarily an expectation of repetition around that. I think one of the other things that you need to bear in mind when you're looking at the balance sheet, Tom, is that, in the first quarter, we transferred almost $6 billion out of loans and advances to customers or held for sale, and that came out of our legacy book in Global Banking and Markets and out of our run-off CML portfolio. The majority of that, the vast majority, 80% of it, coming out of the CML portfolio in the U.S.\\nOperator\\nOur next question today comes from Rohith Chandra-Rajan from Barclays.\\nRohith Chandra-Rajan\\nA couple, if I could, please. The first one, just on costs. Obviously, good performance there, helping to offset some of the revenue pressures. Just wondering on the sort of $7.5 billion underlying costs, how feasible that is to hold that relatively flat throughout the rest of the year. Obviously, you've got the bank levy in the fourth quarter, but at the moment, you're being able to offset the regulatory spend and inflation through ongoing cost reductions. So just a comment on how you see that progressing through the year. And then just on the RWA side of things, you highlight that you're halfway through the reduction plan. Could you just give us some insight as to what you expect for the rest of the year? And then secondly, also on timing of Brazil, I mean it sounds like you're now quite close to that being finalized. Is the middle of the year realistic? And can you remind us on the RWA reduction there, please?\\nIain Mackay\\nYes, on Brazil, I think we're looking to -- our expectation is that we'll close in the first half of the year, so by the time we speak to you next, hopefully, we will have that transaction closed and the benefits coming through both the P&L and capital. And that's really one of the reasons that we provided a little bit more insight on the impact on the Brazilian numbers in the overall group so that you can track it through each of the 4 quarters this year. In terms of the RWA reduction, I think it was about $30 billion, if I remember correctly. We'll dig that one out for you. And then in terms of impact on capital overall, it's about 60 basis points. On RWA -- sorry, it was $37 billion coming through the risk-weighted assets on the disposal of Brazil. In terms of progress in RWAs for the remainder of the year, I'd probably sum it up in one word: progress. $15 billion in the first quarter. Obviously, we've made good progress, as Stuart mentioned, in terms of getting more out of the CML portfolio in the month of April. And as I just mentioned, we've transferred a substantial additional balance to held for sale out of the CML book. And that continues at pace. The U.S. team has done a great job there. And we'll continue to make progress with the Global Banking and Markets business, both in terms of legacy portfolio as well as just continued improved management of the capital efficiency across the various models that we've got and the customer base that we've got in RWAs. But as I mentioned, it's not something that we are planning from a linear perspective.\\nStuart Gulliver\\nYes, look, it's not linear, but if you just look at some stats: Global Banking and Markets has achieved 60% of its target already, so $84 billion out of a $141 billion target; CMB, 85% of its target has been achieved, so $25.4 billion out of $30 billion; and the U.S. CMLs, 43% of its 2015 to '17 target achieved. So as Iain says, this is not going to be equal parts month by month, but this is a huge focus.\\nIain Mackay\\nAnd on the costs, Rohith, we will -- we did not actually expect to keep costs flat over the remainder of the year. I think clearly what you saw in the first quarter in terms of Global Banking and Markets, our costs are managed there, certainly in line with overall revenues when it comes to the performance. The performance cost for employees, if the revenue doesn't come through, then the accrual for bonus doesn't come through with it. But broadly speaking, as we talked about back in June of last year and again today, we continue to invest significantly in Global Standards and wider regulatory programs. There's an investment cycle which would provide a little bit more detail about back last June, and we expect that investment cycle to continue through 2016 and really only start to realize significant benefits in terms of lower costs in that particular space as we work through 2017. So we feel there was great progress made in the first quarter of 2016. We do have investment programs that we need to continue through the remainder of '16. And that will put some upward pressure on the overall cost base for the remainder of this year.\\nRohith Chandra-Rajan\\nSo just on that, Iain, sorry. So the regulatory program and compliance costs of $0.7 billion in the quarter, you'd expect to trend up a bit from here. Is that what you're saying?\\nIain Mackay\\nWe do as that investment continues apace. And most of the investment is focused around the deployment of technology and automation into the countries in which we operate today. And as we get to that point, then the overall cost of compliance, we expect to be much more manageable; and possibly to see marginal, but only marginal reductions in the overall costs associated with that. But the investment cycle continues through '16, and we'll start to realize the benefits of that in '17.\\nOperator\\nOur next question today comes from Manus Costello from Autonomous.\\nManus Costello\\nI had a question about your AT1 issuance, please. There was a report in the press last week that the regulator had asked you to issue and you had politely declined. I wondered if you wanted to comment on that incident and more generally comment on what your calendar is like for issuing AT1. Because you've obviously still got a reasonable amount to issue before you hit your target.\\nIain Mackay\\nWell, first of all, I'd say don't believe everything you read in the FT. A fairest point would be a misquoted in an off-the-record conversation. Our regulator did not specifically request us to make issuance into the market, although a number of our investors did. I can well imagine the motivation behind that considering the higher premiums that have been associated with those kinds of issuances back in January and February. Insofar as our AT1 calendar goes, we would expect -- provided pricing is reasonably good, which it actually is at this precise moment in time, we would expect to be out in the market this quarter for AT1s, Tier 2s and other TLAC qualifying securities. We got $10.5 billion out in the first quarter at slightly higher sort of spreads than we would necessarily have liked, but they came in quite nicely at the end of February and into March. So we got $10.5 billion out. And certainly, in terms of volume of issuance through the second quarter, it would be similar or possibly slightly more in the second quarter. When you think overall at our program of issuance, we've got, over the next 3 years, about $50 billion of maturity coming through for refinancing. And then on top of that, we've got somewhere between $10 billion and $30 billion of new issuance to do to ensure that we meet the overall TLAC requirements by the beginning of 2019. And clearly, our view is to try and get as much of a jump on that in 2016 as we can provided the market conditions are reasonably supportive of that.\\nManus Costello\\nAnd when you talked earlier, Iain, about the pressure on the net interest margin from that coming through, are you implying that should start from kind of Q2 as that $10 billion starts to bite?\\nIain Mackay\\nWell, we've put $10.5 billion out. And we'll be paying the coupons on that as time passes, Manus, so yes, the cost of issuing that paper, which, as we've described in numerous occasions before, is surplus to our requirements, will create a little bit of pressure on the NIM.\\nOperator\\nOur next question today comes from Martin Leitgeb from Goldman Sachs.\\nMartin Leitgeb\\nJust a few follow-up question on revenues, please. And your comments obviously on Hong Kong and the loan growth outlook there is helpful. Just looking at Slide 17, where you present underlying loan figures on a constant-currency basis excluding the red-inked balances. And the numbers there look fairly stable over the last 5 quarters. And I was just wondering if you could give us any view on how this could progress from here, with obviously particular trade balances probably -- or potentially stabilizing at the lower level. And in particular, I would be interested in your comments, one, on the potential for loan growth within the U.K.; and in the U.K. specifically, mortgages. Just looking at your disclosure, it appears that deposits kept growing whilst the loan balances, at least on the retail side, kept fairly stable. Do you see the scope there to utilize your competitive funding advantage you have in the U.K. to engage in stronger mortgage grow in the U.K. here going forward? And the second question, on trade finance and element related to commodity prices. With some of the major commodities having quite a rebound in the first quarter, could we see here trade balances expand going forward?\\nStuart Gulliver\\nSo on U.K. mortgages, actually, U.K. mortgage new business is up about 57% year-on-year. There's actually about a $2 billion, nearly $3 billion increase in mortgages. So yes, we are trying to do that. And we've signed up more third-party agents in the first quarter as well. And we've also seen a considerable increase in the number of mortgages coming through on our direct channel, which is actually starting to pick up quite significantly. So yes, we are focused on doing that. So as I say, intermediary performance is up. New business is up. And the amount being onboarded online is also up, so we are trying to do that. If you come to your piece about -- or your question about trade balances and commodity prices, yes, that should really result in some kind of rebound. A big chunk of the documentary credit fall is related to softer commodity prices and actually just lower shipments taking place of commodities. And I think also that the ability to grow the book in U.K., Europe and North America and in Mexico, you can see, in the first quarter, that actually is where we've seen loan growth. Remember also running through these numbers, as we set out on Slide 17, is going in the other direction, obviously, the reduction in the U.S. legacy portfolios, so there is a net reduction going through as we dispose of this as well and as we dispose of legacy assets. So I mean I think we're reasonably confident that we can continue to grow loans and advances and that there is -- as you say, there's a stable picture over the last 5 quarters, there's not a declining picture, within which we may basically offset the declines due to disposals of legacy positions.\\nOperator\\nOur next question today comes from Michael Helsby from Bank of America.\\nMichael Helsby\\nI've got 3 questions: 2 bigger picture; 1 is just a point of detail, please. Firstly, on -- just on ROE, Slide 9. Your costs ex Brazil, you're pretty much already at your 2017 run rate. And despite that, when I look at Slide 12, it shows that your group ROE, excluding significant items and levy, is just 7.6%. So I appreciate that the revenue environment was challenged in the first quarter, but there's a trend where it's been challenged for a while. So I guess the question for me is what's plan B? It really doesn't look like you're going to get anywhere close to your greater-than-10% ROE target, so can you come back to that $7.3 billion cost run rate and make it significantly lower? That's question one. Question two is on Slide 15. You're talking about dividend growth, and you're linking it to longer-term profitability. I asked this last quarter, and your shares are yielding more now since then. Is 8% -- clearly, the market's very worried that you're going to cut the dividend, not grow the dividend, so my question really is what's the longer-term earnings power that you would need to believe in for you to recommend that the board does actually do what the market's worrying about and cut the dividend? And then the third question is just on tax rate. The tax rate was 25.7% this quarter. You mentioned that was because of the U.K. surcharge. Should we use that now as the ongoing tax rate on a clean basis? I just ask as consensus has only got 23%.\\nIain Mackay\\nYes. On the last question, yes, I would use that 25% to 26% as a effective tax rate going forward, informed largely by the U.K. corporate surcharge on taxes. I think, on the ROE, Michael, there's a couple things to bear in mind. That ROE includes really the effect of Brazil coming through. And as we dispose of Brazil, that knocks -- that adds about 20 basis points to return on risk-weighted assets, largely coming through the retail bank and the Commercial Banking businesses. And so that is helpful both in terms of the returns equation as well as the capital and the expense equation. On the costs, you make the assumption that we're pretty much done on costs, and that simply is not the case. We -- the $7.5 billion versus the $7.3 billion belies the fact that we've got continued investment to do in growth initiatives that focus on the longer-term revenue-generating and profit-generating capability of the group. It also focuses on the longer-term requirements for investment around Global Standards and regulatory programs and the offset of inflation. So there remains a very significant piece of work to do from a cost perspective. And delivering against that and at an exit run rate in 2017 equivalent to 2014, whilst continuing to build the balance sheet, albeit perhaps at somewhat slower rates, should increment revenues as we work through those. And I think when you take those factors together and hopefully, but not necessarily planning for a little bit of assistance from U.S. rates, then the mathematics would suggest to us that we can move back towards that 10% rate and, hopefully, grow beyond that. But I think, within the context of 2017, getting there is obviously a pretty difficult challenge, but that's what we're focused on delivering against and a particularly strong focus on those things that are directly within our control; and then taking advantage of any revenue growth opportunities, for example, those that Stuart laid out earlier on. The guidance on dividends hasn't changed, Michael. And it's not going to change unless there's a culmination of factors relating to a wider recessionary environment in the markets in which we operate or a significantly higher set of capital requirements. And as you know, notwithstanding various policy setters' proclamations to the effect that there is no Basel IV, there would certainly seem to be a Basel IV out there with a wide range of reassessment that's in the process of being consulted upon. So I think, until we get capital requirements nailed down, which a year ago I was optimistic we'd be much closer, but I think the events over the last few months have perhaps moved that out into future, sadly, but the guidance on dividends hasn't changed. And if the underlying economic factors and performance factors do change significantly, then we will certainly update you on that, but no change at this point.\\nMichael Helsby\\nSo just on the -- sorry, my first question, Iain. I appreciate there's a lot going on in the cost line, but I guess what I'm trying to get to is if the revenue picture doesn't improve, then clearly, you're only left with one lever to get to your ROE, and that's costs. So I guess the question is to what extent can you lower that $7.3 billion run rate? Is it just off the table because it's too difficult and you're working so hard to deliver that number in isolation?\\nIain Mackay\\nNo, it's not, Michael, but we'll make that determination when the time is right to make that determination. And 2 bad months at the beginning of 2016 aren't really the basis on which we'd make a decision that affects the long-term future of the group.\\nStuart Gulliver\\nI think, Michael, we've had 2 difficult months, January and February; and 2 okay months, March and April. So there's not a trend yet.\\nOperator\\nOur next question today comes from Chris Manners from Morgan Stanley.\\nChris Manners\\nSo 3 questions, if I may. The first one was on Slide 17. Looks actually to be pretty encouraging, the market share gains you're making. Could I ask you maybe to share with us which competitors are you taking share from? You don't have to name them but maybe by type, just give us a sense. And also, now that the volatility has stabilized a little bit after the first 2 months of the year, are the competition regrouping to any degree that you can see? Second question was -- sorry.\\nStuart Gulliver\\nSo we -- yes, carry on.\\nChris Manners\\nSo yes, the second question was just going to be on the Other revenue. That's something I always find it a little bit tricky to forecast. I was just looking at Page -- at Slide 7. It's obviously plus $179 million this quarter. At this time last year, it was minus $200 million. But the last few quarters have been roughly a negative number of $200 million-ish, yet when we think about that line going forward, should that be a sort of plus number, minus number, flat? How should we think about the Other revenue trending? And the last question was just on impairment. I thought it was interesting context you gave us on Slide 18 there of where the impairment charges have been over time. I see you've picked the time period back to 1997, and you've shown us some average impairments in percentages there that seem to be a little bit ahead of where you're running at the moment. Are we -- should we take from that, that you're expecting normalized impairment charges to start creeping up a little bit? Or how should we interpret those?\\nIain Mackay\\nI think, taking the third, first, I wouldn't necessarily interpret anything for it. We provide it as information that, hopefully, is useful to you, to give you some indication that in -- certainly, in absolute terms, on relative terms, the loan impairment charges in the business that matter most to us have seldom risen above a significantly high level.\\nStuart Gulliver\\nAnd the other reason for giving it, Chris, is obviously, fourth quarter -- if you look first quarter of '16, it's much lower than the fourth quarter of '15, but actually much higher than the first quarter. So it's a volatile series. So we wanted to show you what the average was because we thought we'd get a question as to what the average was.\\nIain Mackay\\nYes. In terms of Other revenues, I'll -- Stuart will cover the first one, on competitors.\\nStuart Gulliver\\nYes.\\nIain Mackay\\nBut in terms of Other revenues, I'm not going to try and give you any guidance on the Other. The Other segment, the Other line picks up inter-segment eliminations and consolidation within the group. And it also picks up group elements. And what we had coming through in that particular line in the first quarter was a bit of a hedge ineffectiveness coming through some of the parent company debt that was issued some time ago; and interest rate, whereas interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives that hedge the issuance of that debt. And when you saw some significant movements in both interest rate and foreign exchange in first quarter, then that's really what flowed through in terms of the Other income. So we had a positive effect of about $179 million in the first quarter, and that was largely from hedging effects in this -- on those interest rates and foreign exchange derivatives against holding company debt issued in recent years; and then a negative effect in the first quarter of the preceding year, which was largely in the elimination of inter-segment items. So it is -- it's got some volatility in that line, as you've seen, coming through in recent quarters but, I think a significant amount -- the ability to predict that is largely influenced by the very factors that we saw coming through this quarter in terms of movements in interest rate, foreign exchange and their impact on holding company debt.\\nStuart Gulliver\\nSo looking at competitors\\u2026\\nChris Manners\\nSo we'll be\\u2026\\nStuart Gulliver\\nSorry, carry on.\\nChris Manners\\nYes, I was just going to say so would we be sensible to call that a 0 as we model it going forward just because it's volatile? It doesn't have like an underlying run rate that it should have basically, is that fair to say?\\nIain Mackay\\nNo, there's not an underlying run rate. And it is not an easy item to predict until you start seeing effects coming through: interest rate, foreign exchange and other market movements.\\nStuart Gulliver\\nSo on competitors, it's a bit difficult to sort of indicate who they are without even by giving geographic descriptions without being kind of inappropriate on a call like this. If you think about those banks which have changed strategy and pulled out of Asia, those are the people that we have taken market share from. So the easiest way to do it is by a negative. So the U.S. banks remain highly competitive, but some of the other banks, some other parts of the world have given up on their Asian initiatives.\\nChris Manners\\nOkay. Maybe some U.K. banks?\\nStuart Gulliver\\nPossibly.\\nIain Mackay\\nIt was quite some time ago.\\nStuart Gulliver\\nPossibly. Honestly, Chris, you can kind of work it out, but I think on a call like this, it's not appropriate.\\nChris Manners\\nNo, fair enough.\\nStuart Gulliver\\nOkay, thank you.\\nOperator\\nWe will take our last question today from Stephen Andrews from Deutsche Bank.\\nStephen Andrews\\nJust coming back to the dividend again, just to work out what the actual cash payout ratio is at the moment. I think on Slide 10, you said the dividends, net of scrip, were about $2.1 billion in Q1. And I think you're including some of the pref in that. So am I right in thinking that the underlying payout was about $1.9 billion on the ordinary dividend, so the scrip take-up in the first quarter on the larger, final dividend for last year was probably in the sort of 55%, 60% range? And then the second question is just on the -- your ability to pay the dividend is usually a function of just the cash coming up from different parts of the group. How should we think about -- or how do you think about this slowdown in volumes in Asia? Sitting on the ground in Hong Kong, it feels in some way structural in that you're largely a U.S. dollar lender, a Hong Kong dollar lender, and with the RMB weakening, the demand you had coming from China for U.S. dollar borrowing just isn't there anymore. Whilst that is having an impact on revenues, is this -- should we expect the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp. to be consuming significantly less capital than it was, so be upstreaming more capital going forward than it had done previously?\\nIain Mackay\\nThe scrip take-up on the fourth interim dividend. So we account for dividends on an accounting basis within our capital, so the fourth quarter dividend was accounted for in the capital ratios in the fourth quarter of last year. And the scrip take-up on that was about, just under 10% of the total, which represented about, I think, $440 million, $450 million in terms of cash conservation at the group level. In terms of the upstreaming of dividends...\\nStephen Andrews\\nSorry. I was on -- I meant on Slide 10, the $2.1 billion dividends, net of scrip, which I assume was for the full year dividend.\\nIain Mackay\\nNo, that's an assumption around net of scrip as it relates to the first dividend declared.\\nStuart Gulliver\\nSo that's the first $0.10 of this year.\\nIain Mackay\\nYes, yes. So that relates only to the interim for the first quarter, if you like, or the first interim dividend, to be more precise. In terms of dividend upstreaming from the subsidiaries, we hold the subsidiaries accountable to upstream somewhere between 50% to 70% of their profit attributable after tax. And that is applicable to all the subsidiaries which are in a profit-generating situation. Certainly, as far as Hong Kong goes, like other major subsidiaries in the group, they obviously have to meet local regulatory requirements which the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation does comfortably. And again, the dividend distribution from the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp. is going to follow exactly the same principles as the dividend from ourselves to the ultimate shareholder of the group. It's going to be informed by regulatory capital requirements, the profit-generating capability of the business. And what you can clearly see is a business that continues to be very strongly capital generative.\\nStuart Gulliver\\nThank you very much. Okay, that brings the call to an end. Thank you.\\nIain Mackay\\nThank you.\\nOperator\\nThank you, ladies and gentlemen. That concludes the call for the HSBC Holdings plc's earnings release for first quarter 2016. You may now disconnect.\",\n          \"HSBC Holdings plc, Q1 2024 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2024\\n30/4/24\\nOperator\\nWelcome, ladies and gentlemen, to the analyst and investor webinar on the 2024 first quarter results for HSBC Holdings plc. For your information, this webinar is being recorded. We are now ready to start the webinar, so I will hand over to Mark Tucker, Group Chairman.\\nMark Tucker\\nGood morning to those of you in London, and good afternoon to those of you in Hong Kong. I'm joining you today from London and have alongside me know enjoy. I'll be making some short opening remarks before handing over to Noel.\\nAs you may have already seen, we have announced today that Noel has informed the Board of his intention to retire from the bank after nearly 5 years in the role. The Board and I would like to pay tribute to Noel's exceptional contribution during his time.\\nAs Group Chief Executive, he drags both our transformation strategy as well as creating a simpler, more focused business through the disposal of assets in the U.S., France and Canada. This has enabled us to deliver an improved performance, achieving record profits last year and create a platform for future growth and development.\\nNow, you'll hear from him in a second, has decided it's the right time to step back and find a better balance between his personal and business commitments. As you would expect, the Board keeps succession planning under constant review. We already have started a robust and rigorous process to find our next group Chief Executive.\\nThis process will look at both internal and external candidates. I'm very pleased that now has agreed to remain in his role while this process takes place, ensuring a smooth and orderly transition. And on a personal note, I'd like to thank Noel for his unwavering commitment and dedication to HSBC, which he joined 37 years ago.\\nNow, it's been a pleasure and privilege to work with and alongside you.\\nNoel Quinn\\nThank you, Mark. I'm very grateful for your support, guidance, friendship and partnership. I'm proud of what my HSBC colleagues and I have achieved together over the past 5 years. Over that period, we have hit some significant milestones, record profits last year, the strongest returns in a decade and the highest dividend since 2008.\\nAs Mark mentioned, we have created a more focused business, and I believe we have built a strong platform for the bank's next phase of development and growth. That's why I feel this is the right time to step back to find a better balance between my personal and business commitments with the intention going forward after a break of pursuing a portfolio career.\\nWhen I reflect back on the last 37 years, I have held intensive leadership roles, particularly since I took over the U.K. Commercial Bank in October of 2008. After 16 years of intensive leadership, I'm ready for a change. But it's also a natural inflection point for the bank as it comes to the end of the current transformation phase. It's an ideal time to bring in new leadership.\\nThe Board has now started a process to find my successor, and I'm very happy to continue in my role as that process takes place. Rest assured, I will be working hard to ensure a smooth and orderly transition for my successor and to keep the momentum going in this business, as you have seen in Q1. Until then, it's business as usual.\\nSo, let's now turn to our Q1 results, which have showed continued progress. We had a good first quarter. Reported profit before tax was $12.7 billion. Excluding notable items, profit before tax was $9 billion. Our return on tangible equity was 16.4%, excluding notable items. I'm also pleased with the further capital distributions of $8.8 billion, which brings the total amount of distributed capital by way of dividends and buybacks over the last 15 months to almost $28 billion.\\nAnd we are on track to meet all of our previously communicated guidance for 2024. I will now hand over to Georges to take you through the numbers.\\nGeorges Elhedery\\nThank you, Noel. I'd like to open by paying tribute to the enormous contribution Noel has made to the bank. I've greatly enjoyed working alongside him. And I know everyone at the bank has appreciated this strong and effective leadership. I'm also grateful for the support he has shown me personally since my appointment as CFO, 15 months ago.\\nThe Board has announced the process to find a successor, and I know Non and I will continue to remain very focused on the job at hand until that process has been completed. Turning now to the numbers. Reported profit before tax of $12.7 billion was down $0.3 billion in the first quarter of 2023 on a constant currency basis.\\nExcluding notable items, profit before tax was $9 billion, down $0.4 billion on last year's first quarter. On an annualized basis, we delivered a return on tangible equity of 26.1% or 16.4%, excluding notable items. We completed the $2 billion share buyback announced in February in 2 months. This means that since the end of 2022, we have bought back 6% of our outstanding shares. And the trend of strong shareholder distributions continues this quarter.\\nWe have announced, as Noel said, a further $8.8 billion of distributions consisting of first interim dividend for '24 of $0.10 per share. The special dividend of $0.21 per share from the Canada sale proceeds and a new share buyback of up to $3 billion, which we plan to begin right after the AGM and complete within 3 months.\\nFinally, we are reconfirming all of our 2024 guidance, including a mid-teens return on tangible equity, excluding notable items and our commitment to limit cost growth to around 5% on a target basis.\\nSo, on the next slide, reported profit before tax of $12.7 billion included $4.8 billion gain on the sale of Canada, partly offset by the $1.1 billion impairment on the classification of Argentina as held for sale. Excluding notable items, profit before tax was $9 billion with revenue growth offset primarily by higher costs and ECLs. Revenue of $20.8 billion was up $0.5 billion on the first quarter of last year.\\nExcluding notable items, revenue was $17 billion, which was up $0.5 billion on the first quarter of last year, with growth in banking NII, partly offset by lower fee and other income. Within that, we saw high single-digit growth in multi-jurisdictional revenue in the first quarter, which underlines the value of our global network.\\nBanking NII of $11.3 billion was up $0.6 billion on the fourth quarter on the reported FX basis, mainly driven by Argentina banking NII as well as the nonrecurrence of the cash flow hedge reclassification in the last quarter. Looking ahead to the rest of the year, a few things to keep in mind.\\nFirst, our Q1 banking NII included $0.3 billion from Canada, which will not repeat in future quarters due to the completion of the sale in March this year. Second, first quarter banking NII also included $0.5 billion from Argentina. This contribution will continue to be highly volatile until the sale is completed, which we expect to be within the next 12 months. Please, therefore, do not extrapolate the $0.5 billion run rate for the remainder of the year.\\nOur banking NII guidance assumes a contribution of around $1 billion in full year '24 for Argentina, which is in line with full year 2023. Third, the banking NII outlook has improved in several respects since we announced our full year results in February. The Hong Kong time deposit mix remained stable as a percentage of customer deposits in the quarter and markets are now pricing in more modest cuts to interest rates.\\nHowever, it is still early in the year, and these things can change. So, we are maintaining our 2024 banking NII guidance of at least $41 billion. Turning to fee and other income. Wholesale transaction banking was down by 9%, primarily due to the normalization of FX revenues compared to a very strong foreign exchange performance in the first quarter of last year, which benefited from higher market volatility.\\nFees from Global Payment Solutions had another good quarter, up by 6%. Wealth is another growth area that had a very good quarter, up by 14% on the same period last year as our investment continued to drive improved results. Private Banking was a standout performer, mainly driven by increased customer activity in brokerage and trading in Asia, but growth in wealth has been broad-based.\\nTo illustrate this, we acquired around 135,000 new-to-bank retail wealth customers in Hong Kong in the quarter. Approximately 60% of these were nonresidents attracted by our service and product capabilities in Hong Kong.\\nBuilding on previous quarters, we attracted $27 billion of net new invested assets, of which $19 billion were in Asia. And our insurance new business CSM was $0.8 billion, up from $0.4 billion in the first quarter of last year.\\nOn credit, expected credit losses were $0.7 billion in the quarter, equivalent to 30 basis points of average loans. These were primarily Stage 3 charges across retail and wholesale. There was a $54 million charge related to our Mainland China commercial real estate portfolio.\\nWhile challenges remain within the sector, we expect a more benign ECL contribution from it than last year. We remain comfortable with our current level of provisions and continue monitoring developments closely. And we are reconfirming our 2024 ECL guidance of around 40 basis points of average loans, recognizing the overall uncertainty from the flow-through effect of higher rates on the economy.\\nNext, we are on track to meet our target of limiting 2024 cost growth to around 5% on a target basis. This quarter's year-on-year cost growth was impacted by 3 items. First, we chose to face the accrual of our performance-related pay more evenly this year than we did last year. This accounted for 2 percentage points of cost growth this quarter. We do not currently expect the total amount of performance-related pay for 2024 to be significantly different to 2023. So, the accrual will be lower over the next 3 quarters than it was in the same period last year.\\nSecond, HSBC Innovation Banking contributed to 1 percentage point of cost growth this quarter as we only acquired SBB U.K. in the middle of March last year. We intend to provide you with a fuller update on that business at the half year, but I'm pleased that it has good momentum. In the U.K., we onboarded 183 new-to-bank innovation banking client groups in the quarter, the best quarter since acquisition.\\nFinally, another percentage point of the cost growth in the quarter was due to the Bank Finland levy and the incremental FDIC special assessment. We remain committed to cost discipline, and we are reconfirming our guidance of limiting 2024 cost growth to circa 5% on a target basis, inclusive of all the above items.\\nOn lending and deposits. There was good loan growth in the U.K., the Middle East, Mexico and Asia, excluding Hong Kong. Loan demand in Hong Kong remains subdued, largely due to the high interest rate differential with Mainland China.\\nOverall, we continue to expect mid-single-digit loan growth over the medium to long term, but we expect demand to remain subdued in the near term. Deposits were down 2%. This was due to a range of factors, including seasonality, the switch from time deposits to wealth products in Hong Kong and our deliberate choice to forsake some highly price-sensitive deposits.\\nNext, our CET 1 ratio was 15.2%, up 40 basis points on the fourth quarter. Organic capital generation and the gain from the sale of the Canadian business enabled us to announce $8.8 billion of capital distributions this quarter. This includes a share buyback of up to $3 billion, which is expected to have an impact of around 40 basis points on our CET1 ratio in the second quarter.\\nFor modeling purposes, please note that the $5.8 billion of dividends announced today as well as the $5.9 billion in respect of the ordinary dividend announced at the full year results in February will both be reflected in TNAV in the second quarter. At closing of the sale of HSBC Argentina, which is expected within 12 months, we will also recognize $4.9 billion of foreign exchange reserve recycling losses subject to any movement in this reserve up until completion.\\nThese losses have already been accumulated in capital over the previous years. Therefore, recognition in the P&L will have no impact on CET1 nor on TNAV. Finally, looking forward to the rest of the year, our good first quarter puts us on track and we are reconfirming all of our 2024 guidance.\\nA mid-teens return on tangible equity, excluding notable items, a banking NII of at least $41 billion, ECLs of around 40 basis points cost growth limited to around 5% on a target basis and a 50% dividend payout ratio.\\nAnd with that, Louis, can we please go to Q&A.\\nOperator\\n[Operator instructions] Our first question today comes from Joseph Dickerson at Jefferies.\\nJoseph Dickerson\\nCongrats, Noel on a great tenure at the bank and well done for the ROE and the capital return. I guess, just in terms of my question, the PD migration in Hong Kong, if you go back to the way you were computing it previously actually looks like it improved quarter-on-quarter and certainly under the new definition, has stabilized.\\nI think it's Slide 17, if I'm not mistaken, in the presentation. Is that a little bit better than where your expectations were a few months ago? I know when I was in Hong Kong recently, it sounded like things were starting to stabilize, but is that better than where you were thinking a few months ago?\\nAnd then secondly, on the buybacks, is the $3 billion number due more to the calendar effect? Or are you looking to kind of boost the run rate there from the $2 billion in the quarter?\\nGeorges Elhedery\\nThank you, Joseph. So, first, on the time deposit reclassification, we have actually reclassified some private bank term deposits to time deposits. This is due to the observation of their behavior and the recognition that they better classify this time deposits. This rebases the number. But as you could see from the 2 choices we have, it does not affect the trend.\\nSo, therefore, the trend that we've seen under both classifications is the same, and we've seen the first quarter stable quarter-on-quarter. It's too early to call it a peak, but we've always expected migration this year to be slower than what we've seen last year. And this just confirms the trend change from what we've seen in full year 2023.\\nAs regards to your buyback question, so the short answer is, yes, this is indeed due to calendar effects. We just completed a EUR 2 billion buyback in 2 months. That's about $1 billion a month. That is the fastest run rate we've done in terms of share buybacks ever.\\nWe are now announcing a EUR 3 billion buyback, which we intend to do over the next 3 months, starting after AGM. We will see how the run rate goes, it will remain at the $1 billion run rate. We will see how it will go.\\nAs regards any future amount of buyback or whether we're doing a buyback, one, it remains our intention to return excess capital to our shareholders through a rolling series of share buyback.\\nAnd, second, we will decide on a quarter-by-quarter basis based on our capital outlook, the loan growth outlook and other parameters as and when every quarter.\\nOperator\\n[Operator instructions] Our next question today comes from Raul Sinha at JPMorgan.\\nRaul Sinha\\nMaybe 2 from me as well. Just doing, George, on this point on distribution and looking at the sort of moving parts for capital, one of the interesting things in this quarter was the move up in RWAs. I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more color on the growth in RWAs. The EUR 7 billion of increase driven by asset quality trends. I think you're calling out is predominantly in Asia.\\nWhat should we think about the sort of outlook for RWA growth from here even if loan build is muted, just to get a sense of the amount of capital that you will have in content terms for distributions?\\nAnd I guess the second question to Noel, just maybe a question for your broader thoughts, no. The 5 years proceeding have been pretty extraordinary, not just for HSBC, but I guess, for a lot of people given in your markets given the pandemic. But when we look at where HSBC is now, you exited Canada, you announced Argentina. You're in the process of exiting quite a few smaller markets.\\nReturn on tangible equity is already in the mid-teens. You're buying back stock at $3 billion a quarter, you've got a special dividend as well. I guess what I'm really interested in is from here onwards, what do you think is left to do for the group to kind of progress?\\nGeorges Elhedery\\nThank you, Raul. I'll start with your first question first. So, on RWA outlook. So the RWA growth, we called on a quarter-on-quarter basis, $24 billion. First, about 40% of it related to lending and other asset growth. And as you can see from our lending book, we've grown our lending book by EUR 5 billion. There's a number of areas of growth that contributed to around 40% of it, $9 billion.\\nThen we've had a $5 billion market tristRWA growth. This is due to a pickup in NSS activity against a subdued 4Q, and it's more in line with their activity levels in the first 3 quarters of the year, if you want. And this is the normalization of the market's activity.\\nAnd then there is $7 billion, which we classified broadly as asset quality. Now, asset quality, first, it is a continuous exercise. We do this portfolio monitoring review on a regular basis. We have recognized across a number of geographies and a number of sectors, certain names, which we've decided to downgrade on the basis that the interest rate pressure on their cash flows has been more severe.\\nYou will not see an equivalent of that downgrade in ECL. And that's mainly because for many of these customers, their balance sheet remains strong. So, we're comfortable with their balance sheet and therefore, there is no ECL implication from this downgrade. But just closing the loop, this RWA downgrade, you will see some of it materialize in our Stage 3 loans, where we increased our Stage 3 loans by about $2 billion, and that's exactly the mapping of some of this asset quality.\\nWith regards to how we look forward, we are very comfortable where we are today. Our credit metrics remain solid. As I say, the balance sheet of our customers remains strong for a number of them for at least the exposure that is collateralized. We're very comfortable with the level of collateralization and the LTV. And therefore, we do not foresee at this stage today any additional action we should be taking.\\nWe will obviously monitor the book on a regular basis as we always do. Noel?\\nNoel Quinn\\nThank you. It has certainly been an extraordinary 5 years, I should say, not just for HSBC, but for the world. And I'm really pleased and grateful I want to pay tribute to the team for the way they've collectively navigated that. And during that whole process, the external environment executed on a complex but absolutely critical transformation plan over the past 5 years.\\nAnd the outcome of that hard work is evident in the financial performance last year and the financial performance in Q1. I also want to say thanks to Mark, with such volatility in an external environment. Any CEO needs the support of their chair, their advice, their guidance, and I've had that all the way through and have had the support from the Board all the way through in navigating what has been a very complex external environment.\\nBut the team, the Board, Mark, collectively, we've done a good job of navigating it. Now, if I look forward, I'm not going to give to do list to my successor because that is not the fair thing to do to anyone. But I will give you some thoughts about what we as a team are very much focused on. And I'm focused on for as long as I'm still CEO, and that is continuing the momentum.\\nYou don't work as hard as we worked for the past 5 years and then take the eye off the ball at this moment in time. So, I'm very focused on a smooth, orderly transition. I'm very focused on continued execution of the strategy. I want to clarify our thinking on one element of the strategy. We have exited a lot of businesses, a lot of RWAs over the past 5 years.\\nThe one thing we've protected whilst doing that is the international core of HSBC. The countries we remain in, the businesses we remain in are fundamentally now focused on the international nature and essence of HSBC, and we will continue to do that.\\nOur key requirement is to continue to deliver good returns that are sustainable and repeatable whilst also taking advantage of the growth opportunities as they emerge in a world that becomes more stable and there are inherent in our customer franchise.\\nTherefore, we're very focused on continuing the development of wealth, our transaction banking capabilities, our global wholesale banking capabilities and then being ready for when corporate loan demand picks up, we can take advantage of that to couple good returns with sustainable growth.\\nAnd I think you've seen evidence of that in these results. Hong Kong is subdued at the moment, but we understand why with the rate differential in China. But if you look at the rest of the world, as George said, there's balance sheet growth in Wholesale Banking, in the rest of Asia, in the Middle East, in U.K., in Europe. We're seeing good growth elsewhere.\\nSo, it's about focus, momentum, continuing to couple good returns with good growth.\\nOperator\\n[Operator instructions] Our next question today comes from Jeremy Hugh at CICC.\\nJeremy Hugh\\nSo, the first question is on deposits. We're glad to see that cat migration in Hong Kong is slowing down, but if not stabilized at this level. But on the other hand, I think the bank has seen some deposit outflow in Q1, while your Hong Kong local peers still see some deposit growth. So, I'm wondering if there is a strategic trade-off between the deposit growth and the cost for you at this stage? And how do you see that trend in the rest of the year?\\nThe second question is on the structural hedge. So, I'm wondering if this quarter, you could share with us some breakdown of our structural hedge and how much did we benefit from the reinvestment of the structural hedge? And if there is any run rate that we can refer to?\\nGeorges Elhedery\\nThank you, Jeremy. So, on your first question about deposits in Hong Kong. So, if you remember at Q4, our deposits in Hong Kong have increased by about $14 billion. What we've seen in Q1 this year is a decrease of about $16 billion. Therefore, you can see seasonality playing across the 2 quarters, and therefore, is broadly stable across the 2 quarters.\\nWhat happened though is, some of these deposit inflows in Q4 related to some deposit campaigns we were driving to drive some of our deposits into wealth. And when you look at Q1, while you see the deposit outflows, you also can see that $19 billion of our net new invested assets were in Asia.\\nTherefore, a chunk of these outflows has manifested or translated into wealth inflows for us, which was the purpose of the campaign in Q4 and explains if you want the seasonality of this deposit.\\nSecond, look, we have a powerful deposit franchise. We have a very cherished and viable franchise. We continue globally being a very attractive deposit proposition for both our retail and wholesale customers. We cherish this. We continue investing in our deposit capabilities. And throughout the last 6 quarters, you've seen how our deposit base has been very stable with our deposit costs being relatively benign compared to some of our peers. Therefore, I won't comment on month-to-month movements between ourselves and our peers.\\nIf I move on to your second question about the structural hedge. So, first, you would have noticed that we increased this quarter, the structural hedge by about $10 billion, taking it to $487 million, with the average weighted average life broadly unchanged at just shy of 3 years.\\nSecond, we commit at this stage to continue our structural hedging activity. Obviously, this will remain subject to market conditions, but we will continue the trend that we put in Q1 based on current market outlook. This activity of additional structural hedging will contribute to a mild headwind toward banking NII. And this is due to the fact that the rate curves are inverted as you know, and you can do the math.\\nBut equally, we also are reinvesting maturing structural hedges at higher rates. And this reinvestment of maturing of structural hedges at higher rates is a tailwind into banking NII. Between the 2 of those effects, the structural hedge activity for the full year 2024 would remain a net tailwind to our banking NII. We have not yet quantified to the market that tailwind.\\nWe're looking at enhancing our disclosure in this space. But that tailwind has been factored into our guidance of at least $41 billion bank NII and obviously, factored into our return on tangible equity mid-teens guidance.\\nOperator\\nThe next question today comes from Jason Napier at UBS.\\nJason Napier\\nFirst of all, just to echo the best wishes, Noel, for the next chapter of your career and private life, I think, a well-earned rebalancing.\\nGeorge, I just wondered whether you talk a little bit within the context of higher for longer, you've referenced subdued loan demand in Hong Kong due to the differentials in interest rates. And I just wonder whether one of your peers has spoken at some length about looking forward to a change in asset mix as loan demand comes back as a way to defend margins and revenue.\\nSo, I wonder whether you might talk a little bit about whether that's a material part of the plan? And sort of what do you think that means for revenue sort of evolution in the next few quarters? I think I certainly was somewhat surprised that we didn't see an upgrade to banking NII guidance this quarter. I know you don't rebalance every quarter, but I just wonder whether you might talk to the role that Higher for longer has on asset mix and then on credit demand.\\nAnd then secondly, wealth was phenomenal in Q1. I know there's a part of the business that's quite closely linked to what goes on with the Hang Seng Index, which is now 20% in in a short space of time. But I just wonder whether you could talk to the sustainability of those run rates. Is that the strategy delivering the sort of net new money flows? Or is there an element of sort of market volume there that we should be a little bit careful about?\\nGeorges Elhedery\\nThank you, Jason. So, first on Banking NII, we recognize there are kind of a couple of encouraging developments. The first one is the higher for longer on the rate side that would look like more favorable than when we discussed last in February. And, the second one we just touched on, which is the balance sheet mix, specifically in Hong Kong, where we've seen term deposits remain stable for this quarter.\\nSo, we recognize these tailwinds to our banking NII, but we also recognize quite early in the year, and these factors can still change. So this is why we didn't change our guidance. And as you said, Jason, I don't think you should expect us to update our guidance every quarter. We would reconsider this every quarter. But for this quarter, we're just sticking with our at least $41 billion.\\nIn terms of the wealth performance, so recognize mid-teens percentage growth in wealth, 34% for our private bank. I would say a couple of things. The first one is, yes, this is an area that we've already said it's a focused strategic area. We are investing in this area. Big part of our investments goes towards this area, and we're very pleased to see the results of our investments generate revenue fairly quickly.\\nYou can see that through net new invested assets growth. You can see that through our CSM, new business CSM growth in insurance as well as in the actual revenue performance. This being said, I would just caution you not to annualize the numbers you're seeing because Q1 2023 had somewhat subdued January in it when China and Hong Kong were still closed.\\nSo, therefore, you've seen more pickup in activity in the Q1 '23 at the back end of it, whereas we had a full proper Q1 '24. So, there is an element of not annualizing the performance, but expecting that performance to continue growing.\\nI just realized I didn't touch on your asset mix question of the first question. Look, we do not foresee a material change in our asset mix. We had seen for the last few quarters of last year, the main growth take place in mortgages and recognizing mortgages have seen very competitive levels both in the U.K. and Hong Kong, and the margins have been quite tight.\\nAs we start seeing pickup in wholesale demand, as we start peeing pickup in unsecured lending, we are more hopeful that those will drive higher margins than if you want what we see in mortgages. And our numbers in Q1 did show that this pickup definitely is there in areas of Asia, Southeast Asia, India, the Middle East, the U.K., et cetera. And the next in line for that pickup will be Hong Kong, which we expect at some stage later in the year as we see dollar rates ease.\\nOperator\\n[Operator instructions] Our next question comes from Perlie Mong from KBW.\\nPerlie Mong\\nCan I just dig a little bit further into Jason's question just now on higher for longer. So, I know you probably don't like to comment on longer-term NII. But I guess in a higher for longer rate environment, which is how are you thinking about the trajectory going from here because it sounds to me that deposit migration is probably, well, stabilized a lot.\\nAnd I would have thought any longer pricing that hasn't already come through will come through in the next few months. And I guess in a higher for longer rate environment, you can probably build more hedges at better rates as well, et cetera. And there's obviously a tailwind as you mentioned in this year already. So, how does that inform your thinking on your medium-term RoTE? So I guess that's the first question.\\nAnd the second question, again, on broader activity level, maybe not just on credit. So, again, I guess just noting your point that Hong Kong might be a mix in line to pick up. But I guess, overall, the emerging market is probably not benefiting in terms of activity level and in terms of capital inflows from the higher U.S. rates.\\nSo, how does that impact, I guess, trading activities and capital flows, et cetera, just how are you thinking about the flip side of hirer longer?\\nGeorges Elhedery\\nThank you, Perlie. So first, look, yes, we recognize higher for longer is definitely a tailwind or a reduction of a headwind we've forecast in our banking NII. And as I said, there has been a number of manifestation of tailwinds now compared to when we last spoke in February.\\nBut equally, it is early in the year. And as you've seen, these things do change. And we now, therefore, want to bake in some sense of uncertainty due to the changing parameters. We will update some longer than what we're updating but not at this quarter, barely. So, do expect us coming in the future quarters and give you further outlook for the future.\\nI would say the one parameter, just to keep in mind, as you start planning for '25 is take Argentina out because, obviously, subject to the sale completing, which we expect to complete in the next 12 months, that potential $1 billion contribution from Argentina will go away from our banking NII. That's the most kind of predictable parameter where we stand today as you look into 2025.\\nIn terms of the broader activity level, first, if you look at the wealth performance, it just demonstrates how wealth remains very resilient. And that's particularly true in Hong Kong, but very much so across Asia. Second, when you look at our transaction banking activities, apart from foreign exchange, which has an idiosyncrasy related to Q1 '23 with a very high volatility has performed across the various areas of its fee earning activities.\\nAnd then our activity is very much benefiting from cross-border trends. If you look at some of the investments or foreign direct investments or trade flows taking place intra region in Asia between China and ASEAN between India and ASEAN, between India and the west, et cetera, all of those trends are growing. I mean the numbers are staggering in some cases. And these are the activities that our business is operating on.\\nSo, therefore, while recognizing that there will be some interest rate challenges for borrowers at these levels, there is still a very strong underlying network activity, which is benefiting our overall businesses, particularly in wholesale transaction banking, anyway.\\nPerlie Mong\\nOn that, it's just I've also noticed that China exports volumes have been going up, but value has been coming down. And that is in part because of various things. FX is be part of it but also government subsidies. How does that affect your, I guess, your profitability in the region, volumes going up, the value is going down?\\nGeorges Elhedery\\nPerlie, if I can just give you an indication. What we are seeing at the moment is a very strong level of activity of China corporates expanding across the rest of Asia.\\nSo, our outbound activity from Mainland China to the rest of the world is seeing a significant increase in activity over the past 12 months. We've seen that trend continue in the first quarter of this year. So, a lot of people talk about inward investment into China slowing down. But what I would say is outward investment from China to the rest of the world is actually picking up at quite a pace a very significant pace.\\nWe're very well placed to capture that outflow, and we are capturing that outflow. And our business in Mainland China performed well last year. It's performing well again in the first quarter of this year and its outbound activity is performing extremely well. So, we'll give more updates on that at the half year, but we are capturing that. And that is why actually I think the rest of Asia is performing well on balance sheet because a lot of it is being fed by good intra-Asia activity and outbound from Mainland China.\\nOperator\\nNext question today comes from Katherine Lei at JPMorgan.\\nKatherine Lei\\nI have 3 questions, 3 small questions, actually. The first one is on noninterest income. I look at the breakdown of noninterest income. It seems like wealth is doing quite well. But on Transaction Banking, there is some weakness, I think it's down 9% Y-o-Y. Can we know what is the reason? And how should we triangulate this to the full year? What are the drivers to that? So this is the first one.\\nThe second one is on Hong Kong. With Hong Kong relaxing LTV ratios, I think basically, not only they would be they relax the purchase requirements and the stability requirements on residential properties. So, I think that there is a significant jump in transaction. So, I was thinking that this should be positive to mortgage at least, and then we are a big mortgage providers in Hong Kong.\\nSo, will that have any impact on our outlook in terms of growth, particularly related to Hong Kong? Second one. And then the last one, I think, is on cost. If I look at the first quarter, I think cost is up 8%, including levy. How should I look at this? And then are we on track to the 5% cost growth this year?\\nGeorges Elhedery\\nThank you, Katherine. I'll take question 1 and 3, and I'll hand over to Noel to address your second question about the outlook for Hong Kong. So, first on non-NII.\\nWealth has performed well. Transaction banking weakness is specifically due to foreign exchange. That's driving the whole weakness. And the reason, as I called it out earlier, the reason is that foreign exchange had a record strong quarter 1 '23 on the back of heightened market anxiety and volatility back then due to the banking crisis.\\nSo, therefore, we're doing a comparison to a record quarter, and it will show that drop. But if you look at the number itself, and the revenue itself for foreign exchange, it is back to normalized levels. So, there is nothing to worry about here. It's on the contrary back to normalized levels, and we continue to expect some cyclicality in that space, while we continue expecting growth in the other areas of transaction banking.\\nSo, I wouldn't read more than that into it, and we remain very confident that the investment we're putting both in wealth and transaction banking and in the technology supporting our transaction banking activities do remain strategic focus and bearing results as we look into future quarters and years.\\nOn your third question about cost. So, first, I just want to reiterate, it is a clear priority for us to maintain cost discipline, okay? And we are very confident we will limit cost growth to circa 5%. We will limit cost growth to circa 5% on a target basis.\\nWe're confident about it. And we're actually on track to do so. And the reason why we're kind of on track to do so yet, we showed a 7% quarter 1 growth on a target basis is because of a few idiosyncratic items related to the quarter, which are not repeated in future quarters or some of them will reverse in future quarters. I'll just call the 3 of them out that matter.\\nFirst, there was a 2% accrual of the performance-related pay where we decided to phase that accrual more evenly throughout the year than we did last year. This will manifest in a higher performance-related pay accrual in Q1, hence, the 2% contribution towards the 7%, but it will contribute to lower accrual in future quarters because on a full year basis, we are not accruing to a significantly different number than the full year '23 performance-related pay.\\nSecond, there was 1% contribution from HSBC Innovation Banking this quarter because last year's first quarter, we only acquired SBB in the middle of March, which means we practically didn't have it in the first quarter last year, and that's a base effect.\\nAnd then third, we had the one-offs or the expected nonrecurrence of the FDIC special assessment additional charge this quarter as well as the bank of in levy. Bank of Finland levy is a new charge, which used to be an interest expense as an NII and now it's moved to operations expense as in cost. And between the 2 of them, they contributed to 1%.\\nSo, if you adjust for those and you bake them in, we're still and remain confident to meet our 5% cost target on a full year or circa 5% on a full year basis. On your second question, I'll hand over to Noel.\\nNoel Quinn\\nKatherine, I was in Hong Kong recently and spoke to a number of the market participants there and the developers. And I think firstly, I think the change to the stamp duty arrangements in Hong Kong in March in the budget was very well received, and it's had a positive impact on the activity levels of sales in the Hong Kong market residential sales. It was an extremely significant inflow of activity in the first month. That will be very beneficial to the liquidity positions of many of those developers.\\nWe have to wait and see how that stabilizes because undoubtedly, there was an element of catch up in that first month because people were anticipating some change. Therefore, there was low activity in the preceding months. And then we got to see how that stabilizes. But I think that is a very positive move. It will enhance liquidity within the market. It will enhance activity in the mortgage market. But I think it's too early to call a trend at the moment. I think we need to see how Q2 stabilizes following those changes, but a very helpful intervention.\\nOperator\\nCoombs\\\" type=\\\"A\\\"\\nGeorges Elhedery\\nThank you, Andrew. So the UK NIM was up 6 basis points, indeed, essentially benefited from some idiosyncrasies of structural hedges and timing of structural hedge maturities and reinvestments.\\nSo, if you consider broadly flat to be broadly a range of plus or minus 10 basis points. I would say U.K. NIM has been broadly flat for the last couple of quarters. And we foresee it to remain broadly flat in the next quarter. And you will, therefore, add to that broadly flat, some structural hedge due increases, which will drive you within this plus or minus 10 basis point range.\\nAs regards our loans and deposits have been stable. Again, the U.K. economy has been resilient, we're very optimistic about the outlook for the U.K., specifically around inflation and employment. It remains a very important customer franchise for us. It remains a very important market for us, and we continue gaining market share.\\nI mean, we continue gaining market share in mortgages with a 10% new business market share when our back book now market share has moved or our kind of overall portfolio market shares moved from 7% to 8%. We are a 25% market share in SME lending.\\nAnd obviously, we continue investing in this business. You can look at the ring-fenced bank cost growth and how much we can support cost and investment growth for their infants bank within our overall circa 5% cost growth.\\nSo, all this demonstrates the confidence we have in our business in the U.K., our client activity in the U.K. and the outlook for the U.K. If I move to Argentina, I wish I could give you a trend for Argentina, then the way it works is the numbers balloon with hyperinflation, and then they kind of they shrink with devaluation, and it depends how they manifest themselves over month-over-month.\\nQ4 last year has seen hyperinflation to some level, but they have seen a massive devaluation. If you recall, in December, we've seen more than 50% currency devaluation. That's contributed to a disinflation of the amount that Banking Argentina brought to Q4. And then this quarter is exactly the opposite. We've seen 6% devaluation only, but we've seen 54% inflation, and that will just inflate the numbers.\\nSo, it will be volatile quarter-on-quarter. And our best estimate for the full year is that it may average out to what it averaged out over the last year, which is around EUR 1 billion. Now just looking at the overall Argentina, if you take in the nonbanking NII, you take in the cost base, et cetera, last year's Argentina contribution to our PBT was $0.2 billion. Just to put it in perspective, this is about $0.01 earnings per share or 0.5% dividend per share.\\nTherefore, I think as you look at the full year '24, that's the quantum that Argentina volatility will create. So, it should not distract you from the way you're forecasting the bank's outcomes.\\nAndrew Coombs\\nI guess just to follow up on this. In a scenario whereby you didn't have any devaluation of peso. Inflation was a more moderate normal amount? And what would the NII contribution be under that more kind of BAU scenario a quarter for Argentina?\\nGeorges Elhedery\\nLook, again, it's a difficult one to say. But if you just do the arithmetic of our EUR 1 billion expected for the full year, of which already EUR 0.5 billion has manifested in the first quarter. A smooth out outcome would be the other $0.5 billion phased out evenly over 3 quarters. But that's a highly volatile number. So, I wouldn't use it as a \\u2013 as I said a forecast.\\nOperator\\nThank you, ladies and gentlemen. That ends today's webinar.
